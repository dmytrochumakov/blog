      <description>Introduction When you are working on different projects sometimes you need to use different IDE’s. You need to find a way to archive a project in the fastest way.
One of such ways is by using the xcodebuild archive command Basic outline of the process Open Terminal: Open the Terminal application on your Mac. Navigate to Project Directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory containing your Xcode project.</description>

      <description>In this article: What is a Visitor Pattern? What problems does it solve? Real-world code example What is a Visitor Pattern? The Visitor Pattern helps add new capabilities to a composite of objects.

What problems does it solve? The Visitor Pattern helps solve following problems:
Separation of Concerns: The Visitor Pattern separates algorithms from the objects on which they operate. This allows for clean code organization by keeping algorithms and operations separate from the data structures they operate on.</description>

      <title>What are value types in Swift?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/post-8/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/post-8/</guid>
      <description>What are value types? Value types play a central role in programming languages by grouping data values.
`Value type” is a type of data copied when assigned to a new variable.
struct Storage { var data: String = &amp;#34;some data&amp;#34; } let originalStorage = Storage() var copiedStorage = originalStorage // `originalStorage` is copied to `copiedStorage` How can you pass value types? You can pass value type by copying value.
struct Storage { var data: String = &amp;#34;some data&amp;#34; } let originalStorage = Storage() var copiedStorage = originalStorage // `originalStorage` is copied to `copiedStorage` copiedStorage.</description>

      <title>How to prevent memory leaks?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/post-9/</link>

      <description>I was searching for tools that could help me find memory leaks faster and would be simple in implementation without affecting performance and memory size of application.
I found a fantastic fit for this task LifetimeTracker developed by Krzysztof Zabłocki.
All you need is to add LifetimeTracker package to the project, inherit from LifetimeTrackable protocol, and add two lines of code.
class Department: LifetimeTrackable {} trackLifetime method to init of instance that you are going to verify, and lifetimeConfiguration property where you set max number of valid instances.</description>

      <title>What is closure in Swift language?</title>

      <description>Introduction In this article, I’m going to briefly explain what closure is.
Closures is self-conitained blocks of funcionality that can be passed around and used in your code. — Apple
Expression:
{ (params) -&amp;gt; return value in statements } @escaping When closure is marked as escaping, it will outlive or leave the scope you passed.
func response(_ completionHandler: @escaping(Result) -&amp;gt; Void) { completionHandler(.success) } @nonescaping By default, closures are nonescaping, meaning closure will no longer exist in memory after complete execution in the scope you have passed it to.</description>

      <title>What is “reference type” in Swift?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/post-5/</link>

      <description>Introduction In Swift, classes, closures, and actors all reference types.
&amp;lsquo;Reference type’ is instance that shares a single copy of data.
Assigning a reference type to a constant or variable, or passing it into a function or method, it is always a reference to a shared instance that is assigned or passed in.
Example You can pass your property value by sharing the same address in memory.
// Reference type example class Storage { var data = “data-example” } var storage = Storage() print(&amp;#34;\(storage.</description>

      <title>Let’s talk about Composable Architecture</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/post-4/</link>

      <description>Introduction The Composable Architecture (TCA) uses a unidirectional data flow (UDF). UDF is a design pattern where data and events move consistently and predictably. In UDF, data can only be transferred to other application parts in one way.
In TCA, the only way to mutate the state is by sending actions to a runtime store. The runtime store holds the entire app’s business logic and mutates the state inside.
UDF can reduce data inconsistencies because of the single source of truth for the application.</description>
