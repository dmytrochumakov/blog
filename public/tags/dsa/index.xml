      <title>DSA - Sliding Window</title>

      <description>What is the sliding window technique? The sliding window technique is a common algorithmic approach used to create a fixed-sized window that moves through the data one step at a time, typically from left to right, to perform specific operations or computations on the elements within the window.
What is the sliding window algorithm? The sliding window algorithm is a method for finding a subset of elements that satisfy certain conditions in a given problem.</description>

      <title>DSA - Linked List</title>

      <description>What is a Linked List? A linked list is a common data structure that is similar to an array, but its order is based on pointers to the next element in memory instead of using physical placement (indices).
A linked list has two main components:
ListNode class: This class has a val property that represents the value and a next property that represents a pointer to the next element in memory.</description>

      <title>DSA - Binary Search</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/dsa-binary-search/</link>

      <description>What is binary search? Binary search is an algorithm that helps find an element in a sorted array in O(log n) time.
Why should the input be sorted before performing binary search? The input array for binary search needs to be sorted because the algorithm eliminates half of the choices at each step. If the guessed value is greater than the target value, it knows that the right part can’t contain the target value.</description>

      <title>DSA - Stack</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/dsa-stack/</link>

      <description>What is a Stack? A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements and implements operations like push, pop, and peek at the end in O(1) time. It uses the LIFO (last in, first out) order. For example, a stack can be a collection of items where adding or removing is practical at the top.
Code Example struct Stack&amp;lt;Element&amp;gt; { private var array: [Element] init(array: [Element] = []) { self.</description>

      <title>DSA - Two Pointers Technique</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/dsa-two-pointers-technique/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Aug 2024 07:00:23 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/dsa-two-pointers-technique/</guid>
      <description>What is the Two Pointers Technique? The two pointers technique helps track indices in a collection of elements to access objects in memory by index with O(1) space. This technique is very handy when you need to optimize the time and space of a solution.
What Problems Does It Solve? The two pointers technique solves problems involving collections. For example, it is useful when you need to compare each element to other elements in that collection.</description>

      <title>DSA - Merge Sorted Array Problem</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/dsa-merge-sorted-array-problem/</link>

      <description>Introduction In the previous chapter, we discussed Data Structures and Algorithms, delved into an overview of Dynamic Arrays, and solved the &amp;ldquo;Remove Element&amp;rdquo; problem.
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;m going to show one of the ways to solve the 88. Merge Sorted Array problem.
Problem You are given two integer arrays, nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers, m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2, respectively.</description>

      <description>Introduction I’ve always been curious about data structures and algorithms, and how they can improve user experiences while saving money for businesses through optimized computations.
In this series of articles, I’m going to solve LeetCode problems and share my approach with you.
I’ve just started my journey in solving LeetCode problems, so my solutions might not be as efficient as they could be, but I’m always looking for improvement.
Before each topic, I’ll provide a brief introduction to the data structure, algorithm, or technique I’ll be using to solve a specific problem.</description>
