      <description>Introduction In the previous chapter, I started talking about the video game creation process, from project setup to adding the background. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m going to add the player and physics to it.
You can download the project here.
First Step The first step is to initialize player using SKSpriteNode, set up player.position, and add player as a child node.
SKSpriteNode - is an onscreen graphical element that can be initialized from an image or a solid color.</description>

      <description>Introduction I have never tried creating a game before; it feels like magic to me. I know that games have an enormous amount of underlying layers of abstractions and tools such as game engines, rendering, and so on. I have always been eager to learn at least 1% of the game creation process. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;m going to explore step-by-step instructions for creating a game for the iOS platform using SpriteKit.</description>

      <description>Introduction When working in a large codebase with a significant number of async events, I often found myself in situations where I couldn&amp;rsquo;t combine events effectively. This resulted in optimization problems and inefficient consumption of OS resources.
The codebase contained closures and async/await, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible to use operators like merge or combineLatest. After discovering this limitation, I decided to add new methods using Combine.
I will be demonstrating this with a simple NetworkService responsible only for executing and validating requests using Combine.</description>

      <description>What is a Memento Pattern? The Memento Pattern helps return an object to one of its previous states; for instance, if the user requests an “undo” operation.
Source
What problems does it solve? The Memento Pattern helps solve following problems:
Undo/Redo Functionality: Memento allows you to capture an object’s state at a specific point in time and store it externally. This enables you to implement undo/redo functionality by restoring the object to its previous state.</description>

      <description>What is an Interpreter Pattern? The Interpreter Pattern helps implement a simple language and defines a class based representation for its grammar along with an interpreter to interpret its sentences.
Source
What problems does it solve? The Interpreter Pattern helps solve following problems:
Language Interpretation: When you have a language or syntax that needs to be interpreted, such as mathematical expressions, regular expressions, or domain-specific languages (DSLs), the Interpreter Pattern helps in implementing the logic to interpret and execute these expressions.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/the-flyweight-pattern/</guid>
      <description>What is a Flyweight Pattern? The Flyweight Pattern refers to an object that minimizes memory usage by sharing some of its data with other similar objects.
Source
What problems does it solve? The Flyweight Pattern helps solve following problems:
Large Memory Footprint: When dealing with a large number of objects, especially if these objects share a significant amount of common state, traditional object creation can lead to excessive memory consumption. The Flyweight Pattern reduces memory usage by sharing this common state among multiple objects.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/the-chain-of-responsibility-pattern/</guid>
      <description>What is a Chain Of Responsibility Pattern? The Chain Of Responsibility Pattern helps create a chain of objects to examine requests. Each object in turn examines a request and either handles it or passes onto the next object in the chain.
Source
What problems does it solve? The Chain Of Responsibility Pattern (CoR) helps solve following problems:
Dynamic Request Handling: It enables dynamic assignment of responsibilities at runtime. Handlers can be added, removed, or reordered without affecting the client’s code.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/the-state-pattern/</guid>
      <description>What is a State Pattern? The State Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
Source
What problems does it solve? Complex conditional logic: When an object’s behavior depends on its internal state, it often leads to complex conditional statements. The State pattern simplifies this by encapsulating each state and its behavior in separate classes, making the code more readable and maintainable.</description>

      <description>When was it introduced? It was introduced in Swift 5.5 at WWDC 2021.
You can find the more comprehensive info about Modern Concurrency in Swift Concurrency Manifesto.
What are actors? Actors eliminate shared mutable state and explicit synchronization through deep copying of all the data that passed to an actor to a message sent and preventing direct access to actor state. Actors are reference types.

      <description>What is the Thread? A Thread is a small set of instructions that can be executed independently from the main program. Threads are often used to improve program performance by allowing multiple tasks to be executed at the same time. The Thread has its own stack, registers, and program counters.
Threads share memory address space, and it is possible to communicate between Threads using shared memory space. How to use it?</description>

      <description>What is DispatchGroup? DispatchGroup provides a mechanism to track the completion group of tasks.
How DispatchGroup works? DispatchGroup has three main methods, enter, leave and notify, that allow you to control the completion of a specific task.
let dispatchGroup = DispatchGroup() dispatchGroup.enter() dispatchGroup.leave() dispatchGroup.notify(queue: .main) {} Let`s talk about each of these methods. enter — manually indicate a block has entered group. leave — manually indicate a block in the group has been completed.</description>

      <description>What is concurrency? The system can perform multiple tasks simultaneously. By tasks, I mean code or instructions. Modern computer chips have multiple cores that allow developers to create and run various tasks on multiple cores. Even if your chip has one core operating system it will provide context switching mechanism by enabling it to execute multiple tasks concurrently.
Material about processes, threads I will skip explaining concepts about processes and threads because it is a vast topic, and it will take a lot of time to explain it.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/what-are-value-types-in-swift/</guid>
      <description>What are value types? Value types play a central role in programming languages by grouping data values.
`Value type” is a type of data copied when assigned to a new variable.
struct Storage { var data: String = &amp;#34;some data&amp;#34; } let originalStorage = Storage() var copiedStorage = originalStorage // `originalStorage` is copied to `copiedStorage` How can you pass value types? You can pass value type by copying value.
struct Storage { var data: String = &amp;#34;some data&amp;#34; } let originalStorage = Storage() var copiedStorage = originalStorage // `originalStorage` is copied to `copiedStorage` copiedStorage.</description>

      <description>I was searching for tools that could help me find memory leaks faster and would be simple in implementation without affecting performance and memory size of application.
I found a fantastic fit for this task LifetimeTracker developed by Krzysztof Zabłocki.
All you need is to add LifetimeTracker package to the project, inherit from LifetimeTrackable protocol, and add two lines of code.
class Department: LifetimeTrackable {} trackLifetime method to init of instance that you are going to verify, and lifetimeConfiguration property where you set max number of valid instances.</description>

      <description>The common way to find memory leaks is by using Xcode Instruments. All you need is the following:
Open Xcode Instruments
Choose Leaks option Select Simulator where you are going to test your application Select your installed application When you finish preparation, you can start immediate recoding and check application for leaks. To do that, you need to open Simulator and try some cases that could cause memory leaks.
After you spend some time trying different scenarios, you can see that Instruments found Leaked Objects.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/arc-in-swift/</guid>
      <description>What is ARC? Swift uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) to track and manage your app’s memory usage. In most cases, this means that memory management “just works” in Swift, and you don’t need to think about memory management yourself. ARC automatically frees up the memory used by class instances when those instances are no longer needed. - Apple
ARC In Action In this example, we assign an instance to the reference1 property.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/what-is-closure-in-swift-language/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In this article, I’m going to briefly explain what closure is.
Closures is self-conitained blocks of funcionality that can be passed around and used in your code. — Apple
Expression:
{ (params) -&amp;gt; return value in statements } @escaping When closure is marked as escaping, it will outlive or leave the scope you passed.
func response(_ completionHandler: @escaping(Result) -&amp;gt; Void) { completionHandler(.success) } @nonescaping By default, closures are nonescaping, meaning closure will no longer exist in memory after complete execution in the scope you have passed it to.</description>

      <description>Introduction In Swift, classes, closures, and actors all reference types.
&amp;lsquo;Reference type’ is instance that shares a single copy of data.
Assigning a reference type to a constant or variable, or passing it into a function or method, it is always a reference to a shared instance that is assigned or passed in.
Example You can pass your property value by sharing the same address in memory.
// Reference type example class Storage { var data = “data-example” } var storage = Storage() print(&amp;#34;\(storage.</description>
