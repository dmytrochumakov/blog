      <title>Building Video Streaming Widget for iOS App</title>

      <description>Introduction I was exploring the idea of creating a YouTube-like widget for the lock screen on iOS devices. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy because most articles on the Internet discussed general implementations, such as for a coffee shop or a to-do list. Even when I found some similar versions, the project wouldn&amp;rsquo;t compile. I made the decision to approach it my way, so here&amp;rsquo;s what I found out:
Caveats After being stuck for two or more hours without understanding why, after tapping on a button, I wasn&#39;t able to receive a callback from it and the widget always opened the main iOS app, I realized that I forgot to add AppIntent - without it, you can&amp;rsquo;t handle actions for iOS 17.</description>

      <description>Introduction I was looking for a way to add a video player to my iOS app that could be able to play remote videos.
Caveats Problem I found that you can&amp;rsquo;t open Vimeo or Youtube videos because of AVFoundationErrorDomain Code=-11850 &amp;quot;Operation Stopped&amp;quot; UserInfo={NSLocalizedFailureReason=The server is not correctly configured Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=-12939 error. I donâ€™t know exactly what this means, but I&amp;rsquo;m speculating it&amp;rsquo;s related to some protection.
Solution My solution was to find another video that is not related to those platforms.</description>

      <description>Introduction I never had a chance to work with WebSockets, so I decided to take a look and create a group chat. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I discovered:
To be able to send and receive messages, you need to create an interface for communication between a server and your application. In my case, I chose sendMessage and receiveMessage methods. For the server-side, I chose Node.js. For the iOS application, I chose the Socket.</description>

      <description>Introduction I find myself fascinated by the idea of creating an app for visionOS where I could possibly display 3D AirPods that I like. Here are a few steps on how you can do the same:
First step The first step that you need to do is to create a visionOS project.
Second step The next step would be adding a 3D object to Reality Composer Pro and exporting it as a .</description>

      <title>iOS AR App: Experience 3D Guitar</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/ios-ar-app-experience-3d-guitar/</guid>
      <description>Introduction I was searching for an AR implementation of a 3D guitar inside an iOS app. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I discovered:
First Step The first step is not related to building the app. Before that you need to create a project using the Reality Composer Pro app (you can find it through Spotlight search).
Second Step After that, you need to visit https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/quick-look/ and download one of the USDZ files. In my case, I chose the 3D guitar.</description>

      <description>Introduction I was wondering about how to create movie recommendations, so I decided to take a closer look and find out more about this topic. This is what I found:
First step: You need to create a JSON file with the data that you will use to train the model and define the parameters for training the model.
