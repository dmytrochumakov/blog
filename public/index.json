[{"content":"Introduction When you are working on different projects sometimes you need to use different IDE’s. You need to find a way to build a project in the fastest way.\nOne of such ways is by using the xcodebuild command Basic outline of the process Open Terminal: Open the Terminal application on your Mac. Navigate to Project Directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory containing your Xcode project. Run xcodebuild: Once you\u0026rsquo;re in the project directory, you can run xcodebuild with the appropriate parameters to build your project. Example: xcodebuild -project YourProjectName.xcodeproj -scheme YourSchemeName Another way is by integrating fastlane into your workflow: Outline of the process Install Fastlane: If you haven\u0026rsquo;t already installed Fastlane, you can do so using RubyGems, which is the Ruby package manager:\nbrew install fastlane Navigate to Project Directory: Open Terminal and navigate to the directory containing your Xcode project. Initialize Fastlane (Optional): If you haven\u0026rsquo;t initialized Fastlane in your project yet, you can do so by running:\nfastlane init Build with Fastlane: Once Fastlane is set up, you can use it to build your Xcode project. Fastlane provides a lane named build_app for building your app. You can run this lane with the following command:\nfastlane build_app Building a project through a project generation tools If you are building a project through a project generation tool like tuist you do not need anything that was mentioned above because it already has build-in commands tuist build.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post-2/","summary":"Introduction When you are working on different projects sometimes you need to use different IDE’s.

What problems does it solve? Real-world code example What is a Visitor Pattern? The Visitor Pattern helps add new capabilities to a composite of objects.\nSource\nWhat problems does it solve? The Visitor Pattern helps solve following problems:\nSeparation of Concerns: The Visitor Pattern separates algorithms from the objects on which they operate. This allows for clean code organization by keeping algorithms and operations separate from the data structures they operate on. Extensibility: It allows you to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures. This is especially useful when dealing with complex object hierarchies where adding new functionality directly to the classes would lead to code bloat and tight coupling. Traversal of Object Structures: It provides a way to traverse complex object structures while performing some action on each element of the structure. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to process every element of a data structure in a specific order or with a specific algorithm. Real-world code example // Element protocol representing the items on the menu protocol MenuItem { func accept(visitor: OrderVisitor) } // Concrete item types class Coffee: MenuItem { let name: String let price: Double init(name: String, price: Double) { self.name = name self.price = price } func accept(visitor: OrderVisitor) { visitor.visit(self) } } class Tea: MenuItem { let name: String let price: Double init(name: String, price: Double) { self.name = name self.price = price } func accept(visitor: OrderVisitor) { visitor.visit(self) } } class Pastry: MenuItem { let name: String let price: Double init(name: String, price: Double) { self.name = name self.price = price } func accept(visitor: OrderVisitor) { visitor.visit(self) } } // Visitor protocol defining the operations to be performed on menu items protocol OrderVisitor { func visit(_ item: Coffee) func visit(_ item: Tea) func visit(_ item: Pastry) } // Concrete visitor implementing operations on menu items class TotalCostVisitor: OrderVisitor { var totalCost = 0.0 func visit(_ item: Coffee) { totalCost += item.price } func visit(_ item: Tea) { totalCost += item.price } func visit(_ item: Pastry) { totalCost += item.price } } class ItemDetailsVisitor: OrderVisitor { var details = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; func visit(_ item: Coffee) { details += \u0026#34;Coffee: \\(item.name), Price: $\\(item.price)\\n\u0026#34; } func visit(_ item: Tea) { details += \u0026#34;Tea: \\(item.name), Price: $\\(item.price)\\n\u0026#34; } func visit(_ item: Pastry) { details += \u0026#34;Pastry: \\(item.name), Price: $\\(item.price)\\n\u0026#34; } } // Example usage let items: [MenuItem] = [Coffee(name: \u0026#34;Espresso\u0026#34;, price: 2.5), Tea(name: \u0026#34;Green Tea\u0026#34;, price: 2.0), Pastry(name: \u0026#34;Croissant\u0026#34;, price: 3.0)] let totalCostVisitor = TotalCostVisitor() for item in items { item.accept(visitor: totalCostVisitor) } print(\u0026#34;Total cost of the order: $\\(totalCostVisitor.totalCost)\u0026#34;) let itemDetailsVisitor = ItemDetailsVisitor() for item in items { item.accept(visitor: itemDetailsVisitor) } print(\u0026#34;Order details:\u0026#34;) print(itemDetailsVisitor.details) ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post-1/","summary":"In this article: What is a Visitor Pattern?
