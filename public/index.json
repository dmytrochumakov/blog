[{"content":"The problem You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi].\nThe cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the Manhattan distance between them: |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|, where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.\nReturn the minimum cost to make all points connected.

Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points.\nInput: points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]] Output: 18 Constraints 1 \u0026lt;= points.length \u0026lt;= 1000 -10^6 \u0026lt;= xi, yi \u0026lt;= 10^6 All pairs (xi, yi) are distinct. Explanation From the description of the problem, we learn that we are given an array of points that represents coordinates. We also know that the cost of connecting two points is the Manhattan distance. As a result, we must return the minimum cost to make all points connected. This means that we need to create all possible edges between every point and calculate the Manhattan distance between each coordinate pair. In other words, we are going to create an adjacency list.\nFor example, we can start connecting points from node [3, 10], and our edges will look like this: Another example would be if we start connecting points from node [2, 2]: Prim\u0026rsquo;s Algorithm Solution func minCostConnectPoints(_ points: [[Int]]) -\u0026gt; Int { let N = points.count var adj: [Int: [[Int]]] = [:] for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; N { let x1 = points[i][0] let y1 = points[i][1] for j in i + 1 ..\u0026lt; N { let x2 = points[j][0] let y2 = points[j][1] let dist = abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) adj[i, default: []].append([dist, j]) adj[j, default: []].append([dist, i]) } } var res = 0 var visited: Set\u0026lt;Int\u0026gt; = [] var minHeap: Heap\u0026lt;Helper\u0026gt; = [Helper(node: 0, cost: 0)] while visited.count \u0026lt; N { let helper = minHeap.removeMin() let cost = helper.cost let node = helper.node if visited.contains(node) { continue } res += cost visited.insert(node) for val in adj[node, default: []] { let neiCost = val[0] let nei = val[1] if !visited.contains(nei) { minHeap.insert(Helper(node: nei, cost: neiCost)) } } } return res } struct Helper: Comparable { let node: Int let cost: Int static func \u0026lt; (lhs: Helper, rhs: Helper) -\u0026gt; Bool { return lhs.cost \u0026lt; rhs.cost } } Explanation We are going to solve this problem using Prim\u0026rsquo;s algorithm. It is similar to Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm, where you find the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes, while Prim\u0026rsquo;s algorithm uses a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) to find the cheapest way to connect all vertices in a graph with no cycles, and it helps find the minimum total edge weight.\nAbove, we learned that one of the conditions of Prim\u0026rsquo;s algorithm is that we must connect all vertices without any cycles. We can achieve this by using n - 1 edges.\nNext, we must satisfy the last condition of Prim\u0026rsquo;s algorithm, which says that we must minimize the total weight of the edges.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look more deeply at how Prim\u0026rsquo;s algorithm works:\nWe can choose to start at any single node in the entire graph. Next, we are going to perform Breadth-First Search (BFS) on the chosen node. We will also be using a visited hash set where we will put nodes that we are visiting to help us avoid any cycles. Lastly, we are going to use a MinHeap data structure that will help us track the cost from the current node to every single node in our graph. MinHeap will help us find the next node with the minimum possible cost. When we pop a node with the minimum cost, we will add the node to the visited hash set. An example with custom input will look like this: Note, we are going to create an adjacency list for every node to track its neighbors.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at a dry run example: At the first step, we are going to start from node 0 and connect it to all its neighbors. At the second step, we are going to pop the node with the minimum cost; in our case, it will be node 1. Next, we are going to repeat the first step and connect all neighbors of node 1. Next, we are going to repeat the second step and find the node with the minimum cost and pop it. It is possible that we add the same node multiple times. To avoid redundant work, we will use our visited hash set, and if we find that the node we are using has already been visited, we will skip it. We will continue repeating the first and second steps until we connect all our nodes in the graph. Lastly, in order to find the minimum cost, we will be maintaining a cost property that we will update after each iteration.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(n² * log n) Space complexity: O(n²) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-150-min-cost-to-connect-all-points/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are given an array \u003ccode\u003epoints\u003c/code\u003e representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D plane, where \u003ccode\u003epoints[i] = [xi, yi]\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cost of connecting two points \u003ccode\u003e[xi, yi]\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003e[xj, yj]\u003c/code\u003e is the Manhattan distance between them: \u003ccode\u003e|xi - xj| + |yi - yj|\u003c/code\u003e, where \u003ccode\u003e|val|\u003c/code\u003e denotes the absolute value of \u003ccode\u003eval\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturn the minimum cost to make all points connected.

In the result we should return the reconstructed itinerary (flight history of the given tickets) of the man who started his flight from JFK by using tickets exactly once. Lastly, in case we have multiple solutions we want to return the result in lexical order, for example: Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine that we start from node A: One possible solution is to visit node C, and go back from C to A (A -\u0026gt; C -\u0026gt; A)\nNext, we are going to visit node B, and go back from B to A (A -\u0026gt; B -\u0026gt; A) As a result we would have A -\u0026gt; C -\u0026gt; A -\u0026gt; B -\u0026gt; A as a possible solution We can also change the order and visit node B first so our result will look like this A -\u0026gt; B -\u0026gt; A -\u0026gt; C -\u0026gt; A\nIf we compare both of our results we can see that the second result is more preferable because it has the second character B that comes earlier in lexical order than C.\nThe way we are going to solve this problem is by using the Depth First Search algorithm and visiting our nodes but without reusing the same edge twice.\nSolution func findItinerary(_ tickets: [[String]]) -\u0026gt; [String] { var adj: [String: [String]] = [:] let sortedTickets = tickets.sorted { $0[0] \u0026lt; $1[0] || ($0[0] == $1[0] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $0[1] \u0026lt; $1[1]) }.reversed() for ticket in sortedTickets { let src = ticket[0] let dst = ticket[1] adj[src, default: []].append(dst) } var res: [String] = [] func dfs(_ src: String) { while let destinations = adj[src], !destinations.isEmpty { let dst = adj[src]!.removeLast() dfs(dst) } res.append(src) } dfs(\u0026#34;JFK\u0026#34;) return res.reversed() } Explanation To solve this problem we are going to create an adjacency list that will help us traverse the graph. The adjacency list will have the source that we will map to its destinations. We are also going to sort our destinations because from the description of the problem we learn that if we have multiple results we must return the result that has the smaller lexical order. The way we are going to sort our input is by sorting based on the destination.\nWe are going to start building our result by using DFS and a visited set that will help us avoid visiting the same node twice by tracking what destinations we visited so far: We will start from node JFK, after that we are going to visit its first destination ATL, remove it from our adjacency list and add it to our result Next, from node ATL we are going to visit node JFK because it comes first in lexical order, remove it from the adjacency list and add it to our result. Next, following the same pattern as we did before, from node JFK we only have one outgoing edge SFO Next, from node SFO we are going to visit node ATL Lastly, from node ATL we are going to visit node SFO Last note, the example above shows a graph with a best case scenario where we can visit every node. Now let\u0026rsquo;s look at the case when, if we visit the first node in lexical order, we can\u0026rsquo;t go back.\nIn this example we start from node A and we have two choices:\nWe can go to node B first or We can go to node C If we try to go to node B first we can\u0026rsquo;t go back to node A because we don\u0026rsquo;t have an outgoing edge. Therefore, we are going to backtrack to node A and visit node C even though it comes after B in lexical order.\nThis example shows that in some cases we are going to need to backtrack. When we go along one of the edges we might realize that it does not work and we are going to have to reverse our decision and travel along a different edge.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(E * V) Space complexity: O(E * V) Where E is the number of tickets (edges) and V is the number of airports (vertices).

(i.e., no multiple edges.) Explanation From the description of the problem, we learn that we are given n nodes labeled from 1 to n. We are also given the array times that represents our directed edges. The times[i] is a triple value where:\nthe first value ui is a source node the second value vi is a target node the third value wi is the weight of the edge Lastly, we are given node k that represents our starting point, and we want to know how long it will take the signal to reach every single node.\nIn case we have a node that is not connected to the starting node k, we would return -1, because it is impossible to send a signal to a disconnected node.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at the first example and figure out how long it will take the signal to reach every node. Starting from node 2, it will take us one unit of time to reach node 1 because the weight of the edge is one. For node 3, it will take one unit of time to get the signal because the weight of the edge is one. As for node 2, it will take zero units of time to receive the signal because it\u0026rsquo;s our starting point. Lastly, for node 4, it will take two units of time to receive the signal because we started from node 2 (edge weight one), then went to node 3 (edge weight one). As a result, our path looks like this 2 -\u0026gt; 3 -\u0026gt; 4, and the travel time is 1 + 1 = 2. In our output we will be returning the value 2 because it\u0026rsquo;s the largest time that any node needs to receive the signal.\nDijkstra-Shortest Path Solution func networkDelayTime(_ times: [[Int]], _ n: Int, _ k: Int) -\u0026gt; Int { var edges: [Int : [[Int]]] = [:] for time in times { let u = time[0] let v = time[1] let w = time[2] edges[u, default: []].append([v, w]) } var minHeap: Heap\u0026lt;Helper\u0026gt; = [Helper(w: 0, n: k)] var visit: Set\u0026lt;Int\u0026gt; = [] var t = 0 while !minHeap.isEmpty { let helper = minHeap.removeMin() if visit.contains(helper.n) { continue } visit.insert(helper.n) t = helper.w for edge in edges[helper.n, default: []] { let n2 = edge[0] let w2 = edge[1] if !visit.contains(n2) { minHeap.insert(Helper(w: helper.w + w2, n: n2)) } } } return visit.count == n ? t : -1 } struct Helper: Comparable { let w: Int let n: Int static func \u0026lt; (lhs: Helper, rhs: Helper) -\u0026gt; Bool { return lhs.w \u0026lt; rhs.w } } Explanation We are going to solve this problem using Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm, which underneath uses the Breadth First Search algorithm with a queue that uses a heap. In our case, we will be using a Min Heap because we want to find the shortest path that allows the signal to reach nodes first.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at the example: The first step in solving this problem is to create an adjacency list that we will use to map a node to its neighbor nodes. We will need the adjacency list later in our Dijkstra algorithm. We are also going to use a Min Heap as a priority queue that will have two properties — path and node. The path is the distance that it will take to reach the node.\nAfter all preparation steps, we are going to start Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm from node 1, and we will add it to our Min Heap with path = 0 because it does not cost us anything to get there. Next, we are going to pop node = 1 and add its neighbors node = 3 and node = 2 to our Min Heap with path equal to 1 and 4 accordingly. Next, we are going to pop node = 3 because it has the shortest path = 1 (1 \u0026lt; 4). We are also going to add neighbor node = 4 to our heap. For the path, we are going to take the total it took us to reach node = 3 plus the path from node = 3 to node = 4 for a total 1 -\u0026gt; 3 -\u0026gt; 4 equals 1 + 1 = 2 Next, we are going to pop node = 4 because it has the shortest path = 2. You can see that node = 4 has neighbor node = 2, and it has already been added to our Min Heap, so we are going to calculate the distance from node = 4 to node = 2, which equals 1 -\u0026gt; 3 -\u0026gt; 4 -\u0026gt; 2 (1 + 1 + 1 = 3), and add it to our Min Heap. Lastly, we are going to pop node = 2 with path = 3 because it has the minimum path, and we will return it as the result because we visited all of our nodes and found the minimum time needed to send the signal.

Explanation From the description of the problem, we learn that we are given beginWord, endWord, and wordList.\nWe want to create a sequence from beginWord to endWord where endWord is going to be part of our wordList, and beginWord might not be a part of wordList.\nWe also have one restriction that says that every adjacent pair of words in the sequence must differ only by one character. In the end, we should return the shortest sequence.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at the first example: You can see that the word hit is our beginWord, and it does not need to be part of wordList, but every other word does need to be part of wordList, including endWord = cog. As a result, the shortest sequence has length 5 because it has five different words in it.\nAs for the solution:\nWe know that every single word will have the same length. We are going to take two words and figure out what the difference in characters between them is, and if we have one character difference, we are going to form a path by creating a bidirectional connection between those two words. For example, in our input we have words log and cog that differ only by one character; therefore, we can form a path between those two words, and each edge between them is going to be bidirectional. You can see that our problem is more likely a graph problem where we need to find the shortest path from the beginWord all the way to the endWord. The way we are going to do it is by creating an adjacency list where we will be looking for one character difference between words.\nSolution func ladderLength(_ beginWord: String, _ endWord: String, _ wordList: [String]) -\u0026gt; Int { if !wordList.contains(endWord) { return 0 } var nei: [String: [String]] = [:] var wordList = wordList wordList.append(beginWord) for word in wordList { for j in 0 ..\u0026lt; word.count { let pattern = String(word.prefix(j)) + \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; + String(word.suffix(word.count - j - 1)) nei[pattern, default: []].append(word) } } var visited: Set\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; = [] var q: [String] = [beginWord] var res = 1 while !q.isEmpty { for _ in 0 ..\u0026lt; q.count { let word = q.removeFirst() if word == endWord { return res } for j in 0 ..\u0026lt; word.count { let pattern = String(word.prefix(j)) + \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; + String(word.suffix(word.count - j - 1)) if let neighbors = nei[pattern] { for neiWord in neighbors { if !visited.contains(neiWord) { visited.insert(neiWord) q.append(neiWord) } } } } } res += 1 } return 0 } Explanation Above we learn that the first step to our solution is to build an adjacency list. Let\u0026rsquo;s figure out the way we can do that:\nTo build our adjacency list, we are going to look for word patterns that we can create if we change one of the characters in our word. For example, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the word hot: We can transform the first character to pattern *ot. Next, we can change the second character to pattern h*t. Lastly, we can change the third character to pattern ho*. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the word dot: We can transform the first character to pattern *ot. Next, we can transform the second character to pattern d*t. Lastly, we can transform the third character to pattern do*. You can see that the last two patterns of hot and dot are different, but the first pattern is the same, and that means those two words have one character difference. Now we can use the pattern idea to create our adjacency list where the key will be a pattern and the value will be a list of words. For example, for pattern *ot, we will have three words that fit that pattern — [\u0026quot;*ot\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;hot\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;dot\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;lot\u0026quot;]]. If we wanted to find all neighbors of the word hot, first we need to find all of its patterns: For the *ot pattern, our adjacency list will look like this: [\u0026quot;*ot\u0026quot; : [\u0026quot;dot\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;lot\u0026quot;]]. For the h*t pattern, it will be [\u0026quot;h*t\u0026quot; : [\u0026quot;hit\u0026quot;]]. In the end, after all our operations, we can build our graph and calculate the shortest transformation sequence that will look like this: We know that our beginning word is hit and the end word is cog. Next, we are going to use the Breadth First Search algorithm to find the shortest path. We will do it by visiting all neighbors of a particular word. We will also keep track of visited nodes because we don\u0026rsquo;t want to visit the same node twice. As a result, we are going to return 5, because it took us five layers of our BFS to reach the endWord.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(n^2 * m) Space complexity: O(n^2) Where n is the number of words and m is the length of the word Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-150-word-ladder/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA transformation sequence from word \u003ccode\u003ebeginWord\u003c/code\u003e to word \u003ccode\u003eendWord\u003c/code\u003e using a dictionary \u003ccode\u003ewordList\u003c/code\u003e is a sequence of words \u003ccode\u003ebeginWord -\u0026gt; s1 -\u0026gt; s2 -\u0026gt; ... -\u0026gt; sk\u003c/code\u003e such that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEvery adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEvery \u003ccode\u003esi\u003c/code\u003e for \u003ccode\u003e1 \u0026lt;= i \u0026lt;= k\u003c/code\u003e is in \u003ccode\u003ewordList\u003c/code\u003e.

The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.\nReturn an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.\nExamples Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]] Output: [2,3] Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]] Output: [1,4] Constraints n == edges.length 3 \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 1000 edges[i].length == 2 1 \u0026lt;= ai \u0026lt; bi \u0026lt;= edges.length ai != bi There are no repeated edges. The given graph is connected. Explanation From the description of the problem, we learn that we are given an undirected graph. We also learn that the given graph does not have any cycles, and we want to remove an edge such that the resulting graph is going to be a tree, and if there are multiple edges that could be removed, we would return the last one.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at the first example: The definition of a tree says that it must be connected and should not have any cycles.\nIf we remove edge [2, 3], we will get a valid tree. You can see that our given graph forms a cycle, and removing an edge helps us transform it into a tree, so now we can say that our problem is about cycle detection.\nOne way to detect a cycle is by using a depth-first search algorithm with an adjacency list, but in this problem, we will be using Union-Find (Disjoint Set) because it’s more efficient.\nUnion-Find (Disjoint Set) Solution func findRedundantConnection(_ edges: [[Int]]) -\u0026gt; [Int] { let n = edges.count var par = Array(0 ... n) var rank = Array(repeating: 1, count: n + 1) func find(_ n: Int) -\u0026gt; Int{ if n != par[n] { par[n] = find(par[n]) } return par[n] } func union(_ n1: Int, _ n2: Int) -\u0026gt; Bool { let p1 = find(n1) let p2 = find(n2) if p1 == p2 { return false } if rank[p1] \u0026gt; rank[p2] { par[p2] = p1 rank[p1] += rank[p2] } else { par[p1] = p2 rank[p2] += rank[p1] } return true } for edge in edges { let n1 = edge[0] let n2 = edge[1] if union(n1, n2) == false { return [n1, n2] } } return [] } Explanation To better understand how Union-Find works, let’s look at another example: From the description, we know that we have nodes from 1...n. When we start with the assumption that we have a tree, this means that when we have n nodes, we must have n - 1 edges, because if we introduce one more edge in the graph (assuming we can’t have duplicates), this is going to result in a cycle. We can conclude that in order for a graph to be a tree, the number of edges must be equal to the number of nodes.\nNow, let’s look at how we can use the Union-Find algorithm on the second example: The Union-Find will connect two components via the edge:\nWe are going to go edge by edge and keep connecting two nodes that the edge belongs to. When we get to edge [1, 4], we are not going to connect again because nodes 1 and 4 are already connected. Union-Find can tell us that nodes 1 and 4 belong to the same component before we introduce edge [1, 4], and since we know that edges are undirected, we can detect a cycle and return that node as a result.\nNotes about how the Union-Find algorithm works: We are going to go edge by edge. Next, we are going to connect nodes 1 and 2, because we can use node 1 as the parent of node 2, and the rest of the nodes are connected to themselves. Next, we are going to find the parent of 3 by going to node 2 and traversing the tree up to find the root parent, and we are going to connect the smaller component with node 3. Next, we are going to repeat the previous step for node 4 and connect with root parent node 1. Lastly, we are going to connect edge [1, 4] and find the root node for node 4 that will be node 1. This will help us detect a cycle because nodes 1 and 4 have the same root; therefore, we now know that edge [1, 4] will introduce the cycle, and this is the edge that we want to return in our result.

We also know that some courses have prerequisites, and we want to return the order of courses that we need to take in order to finish all the courses. If it’s not possible, we will return an empty array.\nLet’s look at the first example We are given two courses 0 and 1 and prerequisites = [[1, 0]].\nIn order to take course 1, we have to take course 0 first. As a result, we have the array [0, 1]. You can see that we can represent our prerequisites as a graph; therefore, we will be creating our solution around it. Now, let’s look at another example when we have two prerequisites - [[1, 0], [0, 1]] The first prerequisite tells us that in order to take course 1, we need to take course 0. The second prerequisite tells us that in order to take course 0, we need to take course 1. You can see that we can’t take those courses because there is no valid order, and our prerequisites form a cycle. So as a result, we will return an empty array.

Let’s look at the example: The first step that we are going to do is to build an adjacency list that will tell us what prerequisites we have for each node. Next, we are going to build the output using the depth-first search algorithm, visiting every single node: We are going to start our DFS from node 0 and visit our prerequisite 1 that we have in our adjacency list. Next, we are going to visit the prerequisite of 1, which is the single node 3. Next, we are going to visit the prerequisite of 3, which is node 2 that has no prerequisites. Since node 2 has no prerequisites, we are allowed to take course 2, and now we can add it to our output. We are also going to mark node 2 as visited so we don’t end up visiting it twice. Next, in our DFS, we are going to go back to node 3, and since it does not have more prerequisites, we are going to mark it as visited and add it to our output. Next, we are going back to node 1, and you can see that it does not have more prerequisites; therefore, we are going to mark it as visited and add it to our output. Next, we are going to node 0. Node 0 has prerequisite 1, which we already visited, and it also has a prerequisite with node 2 that we can ignore because we have already visited it earlier in our DFS. After that, we can mark node 0 as visited and add it to our result. Next, we are going to visit node 4, mark it as visited, and add it to our output since it only has one prerequisite 0 that we already visited. Lastly, we are going to do the same for node 5, mark it as visited, and add it to our output. In case we detect a cycle, we will return an empty array.\nLet’s look at an example with a cycle We are going to follow the same steps as we did above, except now we have node 2 that points to node 0 and forms a cycle:\nWe are going to start at node 0, next we are going to go to 1, then we are going to go to 3, then to node 2, and lastly, we are going to go to node 0. This will tell us that we found a cycle, and we are going to stop our algorithm and return []. To detect a cycle, we will be using a hash set where we will store the current path, and it will help us recognize the cycle.\nTime/Space complexity Time complexity: O(V + E) Space complexity: O(V + E) Where V is the number of courses and E is the number of prerequisites Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-150-course-schedule-ii/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a total of \u003ccode\u003enumCourses\u003c/code\u003e courses you have to take, labeled from \u003ccode\u003e0\u003c/code\u003e to \u003ccode\u003enumCourses - 1\u003c/code\u003e.

Explanation From the description of the problem, we learn that we are given an m*n matrix that contains only Xs and Os, and we want to capture all regions that are surrounded by Xs. Capturing a region is defined by flipping Os into Xs only if Os are surrounded by Xs. Let’s look at our example: In this example, we have two different regions. We have two regions because we only mark an area as a region if cells are connected in four directions (up, down, right, left); cells cannot be connected diagonally. On the result side of the picture, you can see that the region in the middle was flipped. That region was flipped because it was surrounded by Xs.\nAs for the second region that is placed in the last row, you can see that in the result picture it is not replaced with X. We can’t flip that region because it is only connected in three directions — top, left, right — but not bottom, which is on the border and out of bounds.\nDepth First Search Solution func solve(_ board: inout [[Character]]) { let rows = board.count let cols = board[0].count func capture(_ r: Int, _ c: Int) { if (r \u0026lt; 0 || c \u0026lt; 0 || r == rows || c == cols || board[r][c] != \u0026#34;O\u0026#34;) { return } board[r][c] = \u0026#34;T\u0026#34; capture(r - 1, c) capture(r + 1, c) capture(r , c - 1) capture(r , c + 1) } for r in 0 ..\u0026lt; rows { for c in 0 ..\u0026lt; cols { if (board[r][c] == \u0026#34;O\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ([0, rows - 1].contains(r) || [0, cols - 1].contains(c))) { capture(r, c) } } } for r in 0 ..\u0026lt; rows { for c in 0 ..\u0026lt; cols { if board[r][c] == \u0026#34;O\u0026#34; { board[r][c] = \u0026#34;X\u0026#34; } } } for r in 0 ..\u0026lt; rows { for c in 0 ..\u0026lt; cols { if board[r][c] == \u0026#34;T\u0026#34; { board[r][c] = \u0026#34;O\u0026#34; } } } } Explanation We can start solving this problem in reverse order:\nFirst, we are going to find every region that we cannot flip. Second, we are going to find all regions that we can flip. We are going to scan through every border cell and look for any Os. You can see that in our example we have one region that we can’t flip; therefore, we are going to mark it as T — a temporary variable that will indicate that this region cannot be flipped.\nNext, we are going to iterate through every cell that is not marked as T and change it to X. Lastly, we are going to change back all T cells to Os, and we will return our result.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.\nReturn the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.\nExamples Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]] Output: 4 Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]] Output: -1 Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten because rotting only happens 4-directionally. Input: grid = [[0,2]] Output: 0 Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0. Constraints m == grid.length n == grid[i].length 1 \u0026lt;= m, n \u0026lt;= 10 grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2. Explanation From the description of the problem, we learn that we are given an m*n grid that represents empty, fresh, or rotten oranges. We also know that every minute that passes, any fresh oranges that are 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange become rotten. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the first example: At time 0, we only have one rotten orange. When time passes and we are at time 1, adjacent oranges at positions (0, 1) and (1, 0) become rotten. When we are at time 2, adjacent oranges at positions (0, 2) and (1, 1) become rotten too. Next, at time 3, the adjacent orange at position (2, 1) also becomes rotten. Lastly, at time 4, the orange at position (2, 2) also becomes rotten. As you can see, four minutes later after the start, all oranges are rotten; therefore, we return four in our result. Now let\u0026rsquo;s look at a slightly different example and try to figure out what algorithm we can use to make sure that adjacent oranges become rotten and track the time that it takes for oranges to become rotten. We can try using the depth-first search algorithm. Imagine that we start from the rotten orange with position (0,0). At time equals 1, the orange at position (1, 0) becomes rotten. Next, at time 2 and position (1, 1), the orange becomes rotten too. At time equals 3 and position (1, 2), the orange becomes rotten. Next, at time equals 4 and positions (1, 3) and (2, 2), oranges become rotten. Lastly, at time equals 5 and position (2, 3), the orange becomes rotten. As a result, it took us five units of time to make the given oranges rotten. But five is not the right answer because our first initial rotten oranges will be making adjacent oranges rotten simultaneously; therefore, we can’t use the depth-first search algorithm.\nBreadth First Search Solution func orangesRotting(_ grid: [[Int]]) -\u0026gt; Int { var grid = grid var q: [[Int]] = [] var time = 0 var fresh = 0 let rows = grid.count let cols = grid[0].count for r in 0 ..\u0026lt; rows { for c in 0 ..\u0026lt; cols { if grid[r][c] == 1 { fresh += 1 } if grid[r][c] == 2 { q.append([r, c]) } } } let directions = [[0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]] while !q.isEmpty \u0026amp;\u0026amp; fresh \u0026gt; 0 { for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; q.count { let value = q.removeFirst() let r = value[0] let c = value[1] for direction in directions { let dr = direction[0] let dc = direction[1] let row = dr + r let col = dc + c if (row \u0026lt; 0 || row == rows || col \u0026lt; 0 || col == cols || grid[row][col] != 1) { continue } grid[row][col] = 2 q.append([row, col]) fresh -= 1 } } time += 1 } return fresh == 0 ? time : -1 } Explanation Let\u0026rsquo;s look at an example: At time equals 1, oranges at positions (1, 0) and (1, 3) will become rotten. Next, at time equals 2, oranges at positions (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 3) will become rotten. Lastly, at time equals 3, the orange at position (2, 2) will become rotten because of the rotten orange above it or to the right of it. As a result, in three units of time, all of the oranges became rotten. You may notice that we used the breadth-first search algorithm. BFS is very helpful in this case because we can run it simultaneously on multiple sources at the same time.\nThe algorithm will look like this: We are going to initialize our queue with the initial rotten oranges. Next, we are going to pop the initial oranges, and we will call it 1 unit of time. After that, we are going to add the next rotten oranges to our queue, pop them, and call it unit time 2. Lastly, we will continue following the steps above until our queue is empty. It’s not guaranteed that we can make every single orange rotten. For example:\nIf we take our previous example and add another orange to the bottom left cell, we know that in that example, every orange will be rotten except the orange in the bottom left cell.\nNow, with the information that we learned, we can add an additional property to our algorithm that will help us track how many oranges we had initially.\nIf after our algorithm is done we still have fresh oranges, we would return -1 as our result.\nTime/Space complexity Time complexity: O(m*n) Space complexity: O(m*n) Where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid.

INF - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF. Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it’s impossible to reach the gate, it should be filled with INF.\nAssume the grid can only be traversed up, down, left, or right.\nModify the grid in place.\nExamples Input: [ [2147483647,-1,0,2147483647], [2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1], [2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1], [0,-1,2147483647,2147483647] ] Output: [ [3,-1,0,1], [2,2,1,-1], [1,-1,2,-1], [0,-1,3,4] ] Input: [ [0,-1], [2147483647,2147483647] ] Output: [ [0,-1], [1,2] ] Constraints m == grid.length n == grid[i].length 1 \u0026lt;= m, n \u0026lt;= 100 grid[i][j] is one of {-1, 0, 2147483647} Explanation From the description of the problem, we learn that we are given an m*n grid where each position could have three possible values:\n-1 that represents a wall 0 that represents a gate INF that represents an empty room We also learned that we need to identify the nearest gate to the empty room (INF) and replace it with the distance from the nearest gate to the empty room. If we can’t do that, we should fill it with INF.\nNow, let’s look at the first example: If we start from the top right cell and we are trying to determine how far away the gate is from the empty room, you can see that it’s only one position away from a gate. We can’t go up or right because those positions are out of bounds, and we can’t go down because we have a wall. If we start from the top left cell, we have three positions to the gate. If we start from the second row and second column and we are trying to find the distance to the bottom left gate, we will need three positions to get to this gate. But if you look at the third column of the second row, you can see that we have a gate with a closer distance of two. The brute force way to solve this problem is to use a backtracking algorithm and find the distance for every single position of the entire grid. This solution will work but it will take O(mn4^(m*n)), which is not very efficient.\nBreadth First Search Solution func wallsAndGates(_ grid: inout [[Int]]) { let rows = grid.count let cols = grid[0].count var visit: Set\u0026lt;[Int]\u0026gt; = [] func addRoom(_ r: Int, _ c: Int) { if (r \u0026lt; 0 || r == rows || c \u0026lt; 0 || c == cols || visit.contains([r, c]) || grid[r][c] == -1) { return } visit.insert([r, c]) q.append([r, c]) } var q: [[Int]] = [] for r in 0 ..\u0026lt; rows { for c in 0 ..\u0026lt; cols { if grid[r][c] == 0 { q.append([r, c]) visit.insert([r, c]) } } } var dist = 0 while !q.isEmpty { for _ in 0 ..\u0026lt; q.count { let cell = q.removeFirst() let r = cell[0] let c = cell[1] grid[r][c] = dist addRoom(r + 1, c) addRoom(r - 1, c) addRoom(r, c + 1) addRoom(r, c - 1) } dist += 1 } } Explanation We can optimize our brute force solution by using the breadth first search algorithm. Let’s look at an example when we start from the second row and first column position: We are going to visit all four directions and find what is the closest gate that we can get to. To avoid a scenario where we visit the same position twice, we are going to create a visited set. We can’t achieve an O(m*n) time solution if we are going to do breadth first search from the rooms, but if we do BFS from the gates, we can mark all adjacent rooms with distance 1. You can see if we start calculating distance from the gate with the position of the first row and third column, we have an incorrect distance for the bottom left gate. To avoid this scenario, we are going to simultaneously do a BFS from both gates. When we do our BFS from the bottom left gate, we are not going to visit the second column because it has already been visited.

Two cells that are connected diagonally don’t count.

Let’s figure out what k at a time means by using the example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and k = 2. We can take our input and divide it into groups where each group has a size k = 2. Now we have two groups that we can take and reverse one by one. We also need to not forget to update our links where our nodes are pointing to. As for our last node that stays without a group, with value 5, we don’t need to make any changes to it because the problem statement says that we can leave it as it is. Lastly, after reversing groups, we must put them together by updating pointers. Solution func reverseKGroup(_ head: ListNode?, _ k: Int) -\u0026gt; ListNode? { let dummy = ListNode(0, head) var groupPrev: ListNode? = dummy while true { let kth = getKth(groupPrev, k) if kth == nil { break } var groupNext = kth?.next // reverse var prev = kth?.next var curr = groupPrev?.next while curr !== groupNext { let tmp = curr!.next curr!.next = prev prev = curr curr = tmp } let tmp = groupPrev?.next groupPrev?.next = kth groupPrev = tmp } return dummy.next } func getKth(_ curr: ListNode?, _ k: Int) -\u0026gt; ListNode? { var curr = curr var k = k while curr != nil \u0026amp;\u0026amp; k \u0026gt; 0 { curr = curr!.next k -= 1 } return curr } Explanation Now, when we figure out the general idea, let’s look at the steps that we need to take to solve this problem. We will be using the same example as we did above. For starters, we will need a dummy node because we are potentially modifying the head of the linked list. It will help us deal with edge cases. Next, we will have a pointer that starts from the dummy node. We are going to iterate k times to find our first group and reverse it. After we reverse it, we can set our node with value 1 to the node where our condition is stopped — node after k, which is equal to 3. Next, we are going to set the next pointer of our node with value 1 to the pointer where our condition is stopped — node with value 3. We also need to update the dummy pointer so that it points to the node with value 2. Now, we can move to the next group with values 3 and 4. We are going to update the next pointer of the node with value 3 from pointing to 4 to pointing to 5. Next, we are going to reverse the group. Next, we are going to set the next pointer of the node with value 1 to the node with value 4. Lastly, we will try to check if we have another group, and we will find that we don’t, because the next group only contains a single node with value 5. Therefore, we will stop.

The queen is allowed to move:\nIn any direction horizontally to the left or to the right It can move in any direction vertically up or down It can also move diagonally Now when we refreshed our memory about queen moves, we need to place queens in such ways that they don’t attack each other.\nAt this point we know that a queen can go horizontally, therefore every queen must be placed in a different row We also know that a queen can move vertically, therefore we must place every queen in a separate column Lastly, the queen can move diagonally, and this is the hardest part, because each queen must be on a separate diagonal Now we can try to figure out a way to solve this problem by visualizing an example with n = 4\nThe brute force way to solve this problem is to try to put a queen at each position in our grid, but it’s very expensive in terms of time complexity because each queen placement will take O(n^2) Backtracking Solution func solveNQueens(_ n: Int) -\u0026gt; [[String]] { var col: Set\u0026lt;Int\u0026gt; = [] var posDiag: Set\u0026lt;Int\u0026gt; = [] var negDiag: Set\u0026lt;Int\u0026gt; = [] var res: [[String]] = [] var board = Array(repeating: Array(repeating: \u0026#34;.\u0026#34;, count: n), count: n) func backtrack(_ r: Int) { if r == n { let copy = board.map { $0.joined() } res.append(copy) return } for c in 0 ..\u0026lt; n { if col.contains(c) || posDiag.contains(r + c) || negDiag.contains(r - c) { continue } col.insert(c) posDiag.insert(r + c) negDiag.insert(r - c) board[r][c] = \u0026#34;Q\u0026#34; backtrack(r + 1) col.remove(c) posDiag.remove(r + c) negDiag.remove(r - c) board[r][c] = \u0026#34;.\u0026#34; } } backtrack(0) return res } Explanation Above we discussed the brute-force way of solving this problem, now we can optimize it to O(n) time by using queen placement rules on the board that we recently refreshed. For the first row we can decide to put the queen in any position in this row When we move to the second row we can put the queen anywhere in that row except the position that we chose in the first row, because queens will be in the same column. To do that we will maintain a hashset with columns where we have already placed our queens.\nWe will also keep track of hashsets with positive diagonal and negative diagonal. Let’s look at how we can calculate the negative diagonal If we start from the top left position and then we go diagonally bottom right, we start from position 0, 0 and then move to position 1, 1, then to position 2, 2. You can see that each time we increase the column number we also increase the row number, therefore we can put it into the formula row - column. When we go diagonally we increase column by 1 and increase the row by 1.\nWe can prove that the formula row - column is going to work by using different examples: For the diagonal that starts from position 0, 0 every value will be 0, because 0 - 0 = 0, 1 - 1 = 0 etc. For the diagonal that starts from position 1, 0 every value will be equal to 1, because 1 - 0 = 1 , 2 - 1 = 1 etc. You see that we proved that the formula row - column works for the negative diagonal, now let’s figure out what formula we can use for the positive diagonal.\nLet’s start our positive diagonal from the bottom left position with indices 3, 0 and finish it at position 0, 3 You can see that when we are trying to move on the positive diagonal we increase the column by 1 but we decrease the row by 1, therefore our formula row - column won’t work, instead we will use the formula row + column. We can prove it by looking at examples For the positive diagonal that starts from position 3, 0 every value will be equal to 3, because 3 + 0 = 3, 2 + 1 = 3 etc. For the diagonal that starts from 2, 0 every value will be equal to 2, 2 + 0 = 2, 1 + 1 = 2, etc. Now you can see that we only need three hashsets: columns, positive diagonal, negative diagonal to solve this problem.\nWe will start brute forcing this solution by placing queens using a decision tree At first we are going to try each position in the first row, where we have four choices 0, 1, 2, 3 Next, we will continue doing the same operation, but now we are going to check if a queen has already been placed into the column set or negative diagonal set or positive diagonal set. If a queen has been placed in one of those sets this means that the queens’ paths overlap and we can’t place it at this position. For example, if we decided to place the first queen at 0 position in the first row, then we want to place another queen in the second row:\nWe know that we have four choices 0, 1, 2, 3, but as you can see we can’t place the second queen at position 1, 0 because we already have a queen at column = 0 If we try to place the second queen at position 1, 1 we can’t do it because it overlaps with the first queen on the negative diagonal Lastly, we can place the queen at position 1, 2 or 1, 3 because it does not overlap with the positive diagonal or negative diagonal and they are not in the same column This algorithm will work for the entire grid.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(n!)

Explanation From the description of the problem we learn that we are given string s that we need to partition in a way that all substrings are palindromes.\nOne of the rules that will help us create palindromes is that every single character is a palindrome, because when you reverse it, it stays the same. For example, for input s = \u0026quot;aab\u0026quot; we can create three different palindromes [\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;], [\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;], [\u0026quot;b\u0026quot;]. You can see that partitioning of the input s gives us the opportunity to find the first array with palindromes and add it to our result.\nAnother way to find palindromes is to partition input s by only using characters \u0026quot;aa\u0026quot;, and a single \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;. We can’t add anything else to our result because input s with \u0026quot;ab\u0026quot; -\u0026gt; \u0026quot;ba\u0026quot; is not a palindrome, and input s with \u0026quot;aab\u0026quot; -\u0026gt; \u0026quot;baa\u0026quot; is also not a palindrome.\nBacktracking Solution func partition(_ s: String) -\u0026gt; [[String]] { var res: [[String]] = [] var part: [String] = [] let n = s.count func dfs(_ i: Int) { if i \u0026gt;= n { res.append(part) return } for j in i ..\u0026lt; n { if isPalindrome(s, i, j) { part.append(String(s[i ..\u0026lt; j+1])) dfs(j + 1) part.removeLast() } } } dfs(0) return res } func isPalindrome(_ s: String, _ l: Int, _ r: Int) -\u0026gt; Bool { var l = l var r = r while l \u0026lt; r { if s[l] != s[r] { return false } l += 1 r -= 1 } return true } extension StringProtocol { subscript(offset: Int) -\u0026gt; Character { self[index(startIndex, offsetBy: offset)] } subscript(range: Range\u0026lt;Int\u0026gt;) -\u0026gt; SubSequence { let startIndex = index(self.startIndex, offsetBy: range.lowerBound) return self[startIndex..\u0026lt;index(startIndex, offsetBy: range.count)] } } Explanation We can solve this problem by using a backtracking algorithm. To do that we need to create every single combination for our input that we can partition, and if those partitions can form palindromes we will add them to our result.\nFor example, for input s with characters \u0026quot;aab\u0026quot; For the first partition we have three choices:\nWe can add a single a by taking only the first character Next, we can add two a\u0026rsquo;s by taking the first two characters Lastly, we can add our entire string s. We also will be checking if our partition is a palindrome and you can see that \u0026quot;aab\u0026quot; is not a palindrome so we are not going to continue on this path. For the second partition we also have three choices:\nWe can try to partition string \u0026quot;ab\u0026quot;, and add another single a Another partition will be when we take both characters ab, but we can’t do this because it’s not a palindrome, so we will not be going that path At this point, for the choice with aa, we are left with only one b character, and we can’t add more at this path, so this means that we found one partition where all substrings are palindromes Lastly, we are left with only one choice: to add b to the path with single as. That also will be a palindrome.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(n*2^n) Space complexity: O(n) extra space, O(n*2^n) for the output list Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-150-palindrome-partitioning/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven a string \u003ccode\u003es\u003c/code\u003e, partition \u003ccode\u003es\u003c/code\u003e such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.

To do that we will need to sort our input so the same values will be close to each other.

You can return the answer in any order.\nA permutation is a rearrangement of all the elements of an array.\nExamples Input: nums = [1,2,3] Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]] Input: nums = [0,1] Output: [[0,1],[1,0]] Input: nums = [1] Output: [[1]] Constraints 1 \u0026lt;= nums.length \u0026lt;= 6 -10 \u0026lt;= nums[i] \u0026lt;= 10 All the integers of nums are unique. Explanation From the description of the problem we learn that we need to return all possible permutations from an array of distinct integer values.\nLet’s look at the example with input nums = [1, 2, 3] and try to understand how permutations will look. We have three numbers therefore we have three positions to build:\nFor the first position we have three choices, we can pick any element from our input For the second position we don’t know what element we picked before, but we know that we have only two elements remaining For the third position we only can pick one element If we multiply 3*2*1 we will get 6 that tells us that in total we will have six different permutations for given input [1, 2, 3].\nTo better understand how permutation will look let’s look at the decision tree of input [1, 2, 3]. You can see that we have six permutations and every single one of them is different. We can solve this problem by using recursion but we will need to do a lot of bookkeeping because at each decision we need to add and remove elements. We can choose a slightly easier approach by looking at it from a subproblems perspective.\nRecursion Solution func permute(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; [[Int]] { let n = nums.count if n == 0 { return [[]] } let perms = permute(Array(nums[1..\u0026lt;n])) var res: [[Int]] = [] for p in perms { for i in 0 ... p.count { var pCopy = p pCopy.insert(nums[0], at: i) res.append(pCopy) } } return res } Explanation From the explanation above we learn that we can use subproblems to solve this problem. Instead of branching our decision tree at the first step we can get all permutations from 1, 2, 3:\nNext, the subproblem will be only with 2, 3 numbers Next, we will get permutations for the single number 3 Lastly, when we don’t have any elements we will return an empty array Now, when we have our subproblems we can find our result by moving from the bottom up: If we don’t have any elements we will be returning up an empty array For the single value of 3 we can return only one permutation [[3]] For values 2, 3 we will be returning two permutations [[2, 3], [3, 2]] because at this point we have all permutations for value 3, now we need to add value 2. We know that we have two choices, we can put value 2 in the front of the array or we can put value 2 at the back. Lastly, for values 1, 2, 3 we are going to put value 1 in every position - we are going to try to put value 1 at the beginning, middle, and the end of the array, as a result we are going to end up with three different permutations. In result for values [2, 3] we will have [1, 2, 3], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1] permutations, and for values [3, 2] we will have [1, 3, 2], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1] permutations, in total we will have 6 permutations.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(n!*n^2) Space complexity: O(n!*n) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-150-permutations/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven an array \u003ccode\u003enums\u003c/code\u003e of distinct integers, return all the possible permutations.

In the problem statement, they mention that we can’t have any duplicate values, therefore we can’t add values 7, 1 and 6, 2 to our result.\nAnother limitation that we have is that we can\u0026rsquo;t use the same value an unlimited amount of times, for example, we can\u0026rsquo;t use 1 eight times, but we can use a value that shows up multiple times in our array.\nTo avoid the scenario with adding duplicate values, we will be sorting our input array. This will help us order values so that all duplicate values will be grouped together.

Next, we could decide whether to add another 1 or skip it. Next, we can try to add 2, and after that 5, but we can’t because total sum = 1 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 9, which is more than our target = 8, so we can stop our recursion and skip this path without including any values from it in our result (this will be one of our base cases). Next, we are going to decide to include value 6 and add [1, 1, 6] to our result because the total sum equals target = 8. I will skip explaining all of the possible decisions because it\u0026rsquo;s a very long decision tree and will focus only on values that are equal to target.\nNext, you can imagine that we skipped all values that do not sum to the target, so we can decide to add value 7 and add [1, 7] to our result. Next, we will add [1, 2, 5] to our result. Lastly, we would decide to add [2, 6] to our result.

At most 3 * 10^4 calls will be made to postTweet, getNewsFeed, follow, and unfollow. A user cannot follow himself. Explanation Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the easy part of this problem that are follow and unfollow operations and move up as we go.\nWe can start implementing follow and unfollow operations by using a hashmap data structure where we will be using userId as the key. We also know that a user can follow multiple users, therefore we can use an array to store them but it will not be very efficient, because deleting from the array will take O(n) time. Instead of using an array we can use a hashset that will help us optimize deletion time from O(n) to O(1). At this stage we figure out the implementation of follow and unfollow operations, now let\u0026rsquo;s move to the postTweet operation.\nEach user can post a tweet, so we need to be able to map a user to their array of tweets.\nIn this case an array is working for us because we do not need to search or delete tweets, when we add a new tweet it only takes O(1) time because we add it to the end of the array. An array of tweets will also be useful when we will be trying to get the last 10 tweets in the getNewsFeed operation because the most recent tweets will be at the end of the array.\nMin Heap Solution class Twitter { private var count: Int = 0 private var tweetMap: [Int: [(Int, Int)]] = [:] private var followMap: [Int: Set\u0026lt;Int\u0026gt;] = [:] init() {} func postTweet(_ userId: Int, _ tweetId: Int) { tweetMap[userId, default: []].append((count, tweetId)) count += 1 } func getNewsFeed(_ userId: Int) -\u0026gt; [Int] { var res: [Int] = [] var minHeap: Heap\u0026lt;Helper\u0026gt; = [] followMap[userId, default: []].insert(userId) for followeeId in followMap[userId]! { if let tweets = tweetMap[followeeId], !tweets.isEmpty { let index = tweets.count - 1 let (count, tweetId) = tweets[index] minHeap.insert( Helper( count: count, tweetId: tweetId, followeeId: followeeId, index: index - 1 ) ) } } while !minHeap.isEmpty \u0026amp;\u0026amp; res.count \u0026lt; 10 { let helper = minHeap.popMin()! res.append(helper.tweetId) if helper.index \u0026gt;= 0 { let (nextCount, nextTweetId) = tweetMap[helper.followeeId]![helper.index] minHeap.insert( Helper( count: nextCount, tweetId: nextTweetId, followeeId: helper.followeeId, index: helper.index - 1 ) ) } } return res } func follow(_ followerId: Int, _ followeeId: Int) { followMap[followerId, default: []].insert(followeeId) } func unfollow(_ followerId: Int, _ followeeId: Int) { followMap[followerId]?.remove(followeeId) } } struct Helper: Comparable { static func \u0026lt; (lhs: Helper, rhs: Helper) -\u0026gt; Bool { return lhs.count \u0026gt; rhs.count } let count: Int let tweetId: Int let followeeId: Int let index: Int } Explanation From the explanation above we learn what data structures we will be using for follow, and unfollow operations now let\u0026rsquo;s explore how we can implement getNewsFeed and postTweet operations in more detail.\nWhen we are trying to getNewsFeed with 10 most recent tweets from users that the current userId it\u0026rsquo;s possible that we can have multiple arrays with tweetIds. The problem with using an array for the tweetIds is that we can\u0026rsquo;t only compare tweetId because we don\u0026rsquo;t know when the tweet was posted. Instead, we are going to store a pair of values - the time when that tweet was posted, and tweetId. We can find time by calculating the total number of tweetIds. To be able to find an array of tweets we need to find who the user with the given userId is following - we can do this by using our hashmap with a set of followeeIds. After that, we can iterate over followeeIds and find the list of tweets from our second hashmap. In case we had 6 recent tweets or fewer we will be returning that number. In case we had more than 10 tweets we will be returning the 10 most recent ones.\nWe can solve this problem by using a min heap data structure. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at an example when we have arrays with tweets and we need to find the most recent ones. To find the most recent tweets we are going to start iterating from the end of the array because the most recent tweets always will be at the end.\nNext, we will add the most recent values to the min heap Lastly, we are going to find a minimum value and add it to our result Time/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(n) for each getNewsFeed operation, and O(1) for remaining operations Space complexity: O(Nm + NM + n) Where n is the total number of followeeIds associated with userId, m is the maximum number of tweets by any user (m can be at most 10), N is the total number of userIds, and M is the maximum number of followees for any user.

After completing task A, you must wait two intervals before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th interval, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed. Input: tasks = [\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;C\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;B\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;D\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;B\u0026#34;], n = 1 Output: 6 Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -\u0026gt; B -\u0026gt; C -\u0026gt; D -\u0026gt; A -\u0026gt; B.

There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks. Constraints 1 \u0026lt;= tasks.length \u0026lt;= 10^4 tasks[i] is an uppercase English letter. 0 \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 100 Explanation To better understand the problem, let’s look at a visual representation of the first example. We are given tasks = [\u0026quot;A\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;A\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;A\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;B\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;B\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;B\u0026quot;] and n = 2, and we need to find the minimum number of units of time to finish all of the tasks.\nIf we processed one A, and after we try to process another A we will have to wait n units of time before we can do that. Instead of processing the second A we can process B, and remain idle 1 unit of time and then we can process our second A and our second B, because our idle time n = 2. As a result, we will return 8 in our output. Let’s look at another example with input AAA, BB, CC and n = 1.\nThe first thing that we need to do is to keep track of the count of each character. Next, we will need to figure out what character we will be processing first:\nIf we have chosen to process, for example, the C character first, we will end up adding idle time to wait until we process all A’s, and it will not be the minimum interval. The more optimal way to process our characters is to start from the most frequent character, in our case it’s A. This way we can process different characters and minimize the idle time. Max Heap Solution func leastInterval(_ tasks: [Character], _ n: Int) -\u0026gt; Int { var count: [Character: Int] = [:] for t in tasks { count[t, default: 0] += 1 } var maxHeap = Heap(count.values) var time = 0 var q: Deque\u0026lt;[Int]\u0026gt; = Deque() while !maxHeap.isEmpty || !q.isEmpty { time += 1 if !maxHeap.isEmpty { let cnt = maxHeap.removeMax() - 1 if cnt != 0 { q.append([cnt, time + n]) } } if !q.isEmpty \u0026amp;\u0026amp; q[0][1] == time { maxHeap.insert(q.removeFirst()[0]) } } return time } Explanation The optimal way to solve this problem is to use a max heap data structure. The max heap will help us determine what character is more frequent in O(logn) time.\nWe will be using the time property that will tell us the current time that we are at.\nWe will also be using a queue data structure to store our updated character count, and the time that will tell us when we can process this task again. The steps of the algorithm will look like these:\nWe are going to pop the max value from our max heap, decrease it by 1, and add it to the queue as the first value. We are also going to calculate the time by getting our current time and adding n to it (1 + 1 = 2). After that, we will add it to our queue as a second value. Next, we are going to increase our current time by 1. Now, we are at time 2 and we can see that task 2, 2 is available to add back to our heap, so we are going to pop it from our queue and add it back to the heap. Once time is 0 we are not going to do anything with it, because it does not have to be idle, so we are never going to add it back to our heap.\nWe are going to follow the same process until our heap or queue is not empty.

The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).\nExamples Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1 Output: [[-2,2]] Explanation: The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10). The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8). Since sqrt(8) \u0026lt; sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin. We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].

We can do that by using the formula (x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2.\nWe can avoid using sqrt because we do not need to find the distance, we only need to find which one of the points is greater. When we calculate how far the coordinates [1, 3] are we get the result (1 - 0)^2 + (3 - 0)^2 = 10 When we calculate how far the coordinates [-2, 2] are we get the result (-2 - 0)^2 + (2 - 0)^2 = 8 You can see that coordinates [-2, 2] are closer to the origin than [1, 3].

We can optimize this problem by using a min heap data structure so our overall time complexity will be O(k*log(n)). The first step we are going to do is figure out the distance. We will use it as the first element by putting the coordinates into our min heap because it will be the element that we want our min heap to be ordered by. The next step is we will be popping from the min heap k times, which will take O(logn) time. As a result, we will be returning coordinates [-2, 2] because they have the smaller distance and we only need to pop once because our k = 1.

On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x \u0026lt;= y. The result of this smash is:\nIf x == y, both stones are destroyed, and If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x. At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.\nReturn the weight of the last remaining stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.\nExamples Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1] Output: 1 Explanation: We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then, we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then, we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then, we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that\u0026#39;s the value of the last stone.

In case the stones have the same weight, both of the stones are going to be destroyed. If they are not the same weight, then the smaller stone will be destroyed, and the largest stone will be the difference between the weights.\nFor example, if we had stones with weights 7 and 6, the stone with value 6 will be destroyed, and the larger stone’s weight will be reduced to 7 - 6 = 1.\nSorting Solution func lastStoneWeight(_ stones: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { var stones = stones while stones.count \u0026gt; 1 { stones.sort() let y = stones.removeLast() let x = stones.removeLast() let curr = y - x if curr != 0 { stones.append(curr) } } if !stones.isEmpty { return stones[0] } else { return 0 } } Explanation One way to solve this problem is to sort our input each time before smashing stones.\nIt’s a valid solution but not very efficient because it will take O(n^2*log(n)) time.\nWe can solve this problem in a more efficient way by using a max heap data structure.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(n^2*log(n)) Space complexity: O(1) or O(n) depending on the sorting algorithm Max Heap Solution func lastStoneWeight(_ stones: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { var heap = Heap(stones) while heap.count \u0026gt; 1 { let y = heap.removeMax() let x = heap.removeMax() if x \u0026lt; y { heap.insert(y - x) } } if !heap.isEmpty { return heap.max! } else { return 0 } } Explanation Another way to solve this problem is to use a max heap data structure.\nThe first step that we will need to do is to create a max heap from our input, which will take O(n) time.\nNext, we will need to find the max stones and smash them together.\nLet’s look at our first example and imagine that we have already created a max heap. The first largest stone is going to be 8, and the second will be equal to 7. We smash them together and get the result of 8 - 7 = 1, then we add 1 to our array of stones.

Explanation From the description of the problem, we learn that we need to design the class to find the kth largest element in a stream of numbers.\nIn this case, a stream of numbers means that we continue adding numbers to the list of numbers and after that, we need to find the kth element.\nThe problem description also mentions that we need to find the kth largest element in sorted order, not distinct elements.\nThis means that if, for example, we had input with k = 3, nums = [1, 2, 2, 4] and we needed to return a distinct element, we would return the value 1, but in our case, we need to return the kth largest element in sorted order, therefore we would return 2, because we can include multiple copies of the same element.\nSorting Solution class KthLargest { private let k: Int private var nums: [Int] init(_ k: Int, _ nums: [Int]) { self.k = k self.nums = nums } func add(_ val: Int) -\u0026gt; Int { self.nums.append(val) self.nums.sort() return self.nums[self.nums.count - self.k] } } Explanation The brute force way to solve this problem is by using sorting.\nEvery time we add a new element, we will sort the array and find our kth element, but it’s not a very efficient approach because the time complexity of the add operation will be O(m*n*log(n)). We can optimize it by using a different data structure.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(mnlog(n)) Space complexity: O(m) Where m is the number of calls made to add, and n is the current size of the array Min Heap Solution class KthLargest { private let k: Int private var minHeap: Heap\u0026lt;Int\u0026gt; init(_ k: Int, _ nums: [Int]) { self.k = k self.minHeap = Heap(nums) while minHeap.count \u0026gt; k { minHeap.popMin() } } func add(_ val: Int) -\u0026gt; Int { minHeap.insert(val) if minHeap.count \u0026gt; k { minHeap.popMin() } return minHeap.min! } } Explanation The more optimal way to solve this problem is to use the Min Heap data structure.\nThe min heap approach is better than sorting because adding and popping operations take O(logn) time, and finding the min element takes O(1) time, and we know that we will only be adding new elements. As for the size of our min heap, it will be equal to the size of input k, because if we look at the example with input k=3, nums=[5, 6, 9, 3] we can see that we only need k largest values from the array. In our case, the values are 5, 6, 9. We are never going to include the value 3 because it cannot be the largest value as it’s less than every value in 5, 6, 9. In case we had the value 7 in our input, our sequence would look like this 6, 7, 9, because the value 5 is less than any of those values. Therefore, we now have a new k largest sequence of elements. In case in our input we had the value 2, it would not affect our result because it is less than any element in our min heap.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(m*logk) Space complexity: O(k) Where m is the number of calls made to add Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-150-kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are part of a university admissions office and need to keep track of the \u003ccode\u003ekth\u003c/code\u003e highest test score from applicants in real-time.

Each node\u0026rsquo;s value is between [-10^4, 10^4]. Explanation Before we jump into code, let\u0026rsquo;s figure out what a good node means. The node is defined as good if, from the path from the root node all the way down to the current node, there are no nodes in this path that have a greater value than the node that we are currently at. For example, if we look at the path from the root and the node with value 4: node with value 4 counts as a good node, because its value is greater than the value from the root node 4 \u0026gt; 3 Now, let\u0026rsquo;s look from the root node at the node on the left side with value 1 node with value 1 does not count as a good node because its value is less than the root value 1 \u0026lt; 3 Depth First Search (Preorder) Solution func goodNodes(_ root: TreeNode?) -\u0026gt; Int { func dfs(_ node: TreeNode?, _ maxVal: Int) -\u0026gt; Int { guard let node = node else { return 0 } var maxVal = maxVal var res = node.val \u0026gt;= maxVal ? 1 : 0 maxVal = max(maxVal, node.val) res += dfs(node.left, maxVal) res += dfs(node.right, maxVal) return res } return dfs(root, root?.val ?? 0) } Explanation To solve this problem we will be using DFS preorder algorithm. We are going to start from the root node, after that we are going to visit the left subtree, next we are going to visit the right subtree. To count how many good nodes we have in the left subtree, we are going to pass the max value that we have seen so far, and check if the current node value is greater than our max value, and if it is, then it\u0026rsquo;s a good node. When we are at the node with value 1, we will pass max = 3, and check if it\u0026rsquo;s a good node Next, we are going to update our max if necessary; in our case, our max will be the same, because 1 \u0026lt; 3 Next, we are going to pass our max to the next node with value 3, and check if it\u0026rsquo;s a good node Next, we are going to apply the same algorithm to the right subtree, and in the end, we have four good nodes.

We can frame this problem by finding the rightmost value at each level in our tree. We are going to start from our root - the first layer where we get value of 1\nNext, we are going to move to the second level where we have two nodes, so we are going to get the rightmost value that equals 3 Next, we move to our third layer, where we are going to find the rightmost value 4 Lastly, we move to the last layer, where you can see that we have only one node, so we get value that equals 7 We are going to implement BFS algorithm by using a queue. We will be adding nodes in order (left node first) then the right node, because we always want to get the rightmost value when we add to our result.\nInitially, we are going to add our root node to our queue We are also going to have a res array Next, we are going to take a look at our rightmost value in the queue and add 1 to our res Next, we are no longer looking at the root node, now we are looking for its children, so we will take left and right child and add them to our queue. It\u0026rsquo;s important that we add nodes in order - left first and right second, so this way we can get the rightmost value when we add to our res Next, we have the second level setup, so we are going to take the rightmost value 3 and add it to our res Next, we are going to look at the leftmost value\u0026rsquo;s children nodes and add them to our queue, and after that we are going to pop it The same goes for the rightmost value - we are going to add its children and pop it We will continue doing these steps until we reach the end of the tree.\nTime/Space complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-150-binary-tree-right-side-view/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the \u003ccode\u003eroot\u003c/code\u003e of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"examples\"\u003eExamples\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: root = [1,2,3,null,5,null,4]\nOutput: [1,3,4]\nExplanation:\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-5143c\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-5143c\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/tmpd5jn43fs-1.png#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: root = [1,2,3,4,null,null,null,5]\nOutput: [1,3,4,5]\nExplanation:\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-72c0e\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-72c0e\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/tmpkpe40xeh-1.png#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: root = [1,null,3]\nOutput: [1,3]\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: root = []\nOutput: []\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"constraints\"\u003eConstraints\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e-100 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 100\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"explanation\"\u003eExplanation\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s imagine that we have a person on the right side and if we look at the first example, we can see everything on the right side.\n\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-7cc78\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-7cc78\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/199.png#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - 150 - Binary Tree Right Side View"},{"content":"The problem Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.\nA height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.\nExamples Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7] Output: true Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4] Output: false Input: root = [] Output: true Constraints The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000]. -10^4 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 10^4 Explanation From the description of the problem, we learn that we need to find if the tree is height-balanced, and that we can do it by determining if the difference between the height of every single node in the left and right subtrees is no more than 1.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at the given first example: If we start calculating our height from the root, you can see that in the left subtree we have height 1 and in the right subtree we have height 2. When we calculate the difference abs(1 - 2), we get 1, so this means that our tree is balanced.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the counter example If we take a look at our root:\nin our left subtree we have height 3 in our right subtree we have height 3 the difference is 0 You can see that from the root, the left subtree and the right subtree are balanced.\nBut if we look at the next node and its left subtree, you can see that it has a height of 0, and its right subtree has height 2, and the difference equals 2. Therefore, our subtrees are not balanced, and we need to calculate the height for every single node. Brute Force Solution func isBalanced(_ root: TreeNode?) -\u0026gt; Bool { guard let root = root else { return true } let left = height(root.left) let right = height(root.right) if abs(left - right) \u0026gt; 1 { return false } return isBalanced(root.left) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; isBalanced(root.right) } func height(_ root: TreeNode?) -\u0026gt; Int { guard let root = root else { return 0 } return 1 + max(height(root.left), height(root.right)) } Explanation The brute force way to solve this problem is to recursively check every single node starting from the root and check if the left subtree and right subtree are balanced.\nThe problem with the brute force approach is that we need to go through every single node in subtrees twice. That will take O(n^2) time because we need to check if our subtree is balanced at each node, and since we have n nodes and we need to check n times, we are going to have n^2 time complexity. Time/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(n^2) Space complexity: O(n) Depth First Search Solution func isBalanced(_ root: TreeNode?) -\u0026gt; Bool { guard let root = root else { return true } func dfs(_ root: TreeNode?) -\u0026gt; (Bool, Int) { guard let root = root else { return (true, 0) } let left = dfs(root.left) let right = dfs(root.right) let diff = abs(left.1 - right.1) let balanced = left.0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; right.0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; diff \u0026lt;= 1 return (balanced, 1 + max(left.1, right.1)) } return dfs(root).0 } Explanation We can solve this problem in a more optimal way by using the DFS algorithm. Instead of asking if our tree is balanced from the root, we are going to start from the bottom and move up. This way, we ensure that we visit each node only once.\nWe start from the bottom leaf nodes, check if they are balanced, and then we pop back up. We will also need to get the height of our subtrees—it will help us go up to the parent node, find the difference between subtrees without revisiting them, and find if subtrees are balanced from the parent position.\nLastly, we are going to go back to the root node, and before we do that, we need to calculate the entire height of the subtree. We can do that by using the formula 1 + max(leftSubtreeHeight, rightSubtreeHeight), and we can find if the subtrees are balanced from the root node.

This path may or may not pass through the root.\nThe length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.\nExamples Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5] Output: 3 Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

The diameter is defined as the longest path from a particular node.\nIn the given example, we can see that the longest path equals 3, because on the left side we have our longest path equal to 2, derived from the number of edges on that side. On the right side, we only have 1 edge, so the diameter through the root would be 2 + 1 = 3. The problem statement also mentioned an edge case when the longest path may not pass through the root. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the counterexample: On the left side, we have nothing. On the right side, we have multiple nodes.\nWe can try to find the longest path on the left and the longest path on the right and add them together using the DFS algorithm, but the problem with this approach is that we will be returning the height, not the diameter.\nDepth First Search Solution var res = 0 func diameterOfBinaryTree(_ root: TreeNode?) -\u0026gt; Int { func dfs(_ node: TreeNode?) -\u0026gt; Int { guard let node = node else { return 0 } let left = dfs(node.left) let right = dfs(node.right) res = max(res, left + right) return 1 + max(left, right) } dfs(root) return res } Explanation We are going to solve this problem by recursively running DFS:\nOn the left side, we have no nodes, therefore our height would be 0 On the right side, we continuously go down, and at the bottom, we start calculating our height. Above we learned that the height is different from the diameter, so to find the diameter, we are going to take the max of the left and the right subtrees and add one to it.\nWe will have a local variable res that we will use to store our calculated diameter.\nWhen we reach the bottom, we can see that the height at the node with value 6 is equal to one, and the height for the node with value 7 is equal to one.\nNext, we are going to calculate the diameter by taking max(leftSubtree, rightSubtree) + 1 - max(1, 1) + 1 = 2 Since in our example the left subtree and the right subtree are symmetrical, the right subtree is going to have the same height and diameter as the left subtree - max(1, 1) + 1 = 2. To calculate our res, we are going to take the sum of leftSubtree and the rightSubtree, and if the result is more than the current res, we are going to store it - max(res, leftSubtree + rightSubtree). We will continue calculating our diameter until our DFS finishes its work.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(h) Where n is the number of nodes in the tree, and h is the height of the tree.

Explanation Let\u0026rsquo;s look at our example: From the first operation we get our capacity that equals 2. Next, we have put operation with pairs [1, 1]. We will be keeping added values in order because we want to remember in what order we added these values. In the next operation we put pairs [2, 2]. At the next operation we are trying to get LRU value with key 1. The way we are going to do this is by using a hashmap, because we can look up the key in O(1) time. We also are not going to create any additional memory, because the size of our hashmap will not be exceeding our capacity.\nWe will be using our hashmap by adding the key that was given in our input; as for value, we will be using a pointer to the node. When we execute our third get operation, we will be returning value 1. When we executed the get operation, we made our pairs [1, 1] the most frequently used and pairs [2, 2] the least frequently used.\nWe are going to keep track of the most recent element and least frequently used element by using two pointers left and right, where the left pointer will be storing the LRU element and the right pointer will be storing the most recent element. Therefore, we are going to swap these two nodes. Now we need to reorder our two nodes. The nodes will be connected with each other because we are using a doubly linked list that will allow us to swap nodes in O(1) time. Next, we are going to execute our fourth put operation and put pairs [3, 3] to our hashmap. At this point we have a capacity of 2, and when we try to add a new key, we exceed it, so we need to remove the LRU value and pointer to it and replace it with the new key 3 and create a new pointer.

We also should not forget to update our LRU and most recent pointers after we get the value. To do that, we will need two helper functions — remove, and insert — where remove will be removing the node from the list and insert will be inserting the node to the right.\nWhen we call the put operation and the key already exists in our cache, we will remove that node and replace it with a new one.\nLastly, if our cache count exceeds the given capacity, we will need to remove the LRU value from the list and our cache.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(1) for each put and get operation Space complexity: O(n) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-150-lru-cache/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesign a data structure that follows the constraints of a \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#LRU\"\u003eLeast Recently Used (LRU) cache\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImplement the \u003ccode\u003eLRUCache\u003c/code\u003e class:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ccode\u003eLRUCache(int capacity)\u003c/code\u003e Initialize the LRU cache with positive size \u003ccode\u003ecapacity\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ccode\u003eint get(int key)\u003c/code\u003e Return the value of the \u003ccode\u003ekey\u003c/code\u003e if the key exists, otherwise return \u003ccode\u003e-1\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ccode\u003evoid put(int key, int value)\u003c/code\u003e Update the value of the \u003ccode\u003ekey\u003c/code\u003e if the \u003ccode\u003ekey\u003c/code\u003e exists.

Follow up:\nHow can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums? Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity? Explanation From the description of the problem we learn that we have input of integers nums that contains n + 1 integers. We also learn that we have only one repeated number that we need to return.\nThe brute force way to solve this problem would be to create a hash table and count the number of appearances of every single number and return the number that repeats twice or more times. The time and space complexity for this solution will be O(n).\nBut we can\u0026rsquo;t solve this problem in a brute force way because we are given constraints that tell us that we must solve this problem without extra space.\nAnother way to solve this problem is to use a linked list with cycle detection, and Floyd\u0026rsquo;s algorithm which tells us the beginning of the cycle in the linked list.\nHash Set Solution func findDuplicate(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { var seen: Set\u0026lt;Int\u0026gt; = [] for num in nums { if seen.contains(num) { return num } else { seen.insert(num) } } return -1 } Time/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Fast and Slow Pointers Solution func findDuplicate(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { var slow = 0 var fast = 0 while true { slow = nums[slow] fast = nums[nums[fast]] if slow == fast { break } } var slow2 = 0 while true { slow = nums[slow] slow2 = nums[slow2] if slow == slow2 { return slow } } } Explanation Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at an example with input [1, 3, 4, 2, 2].\nWe know that the length of our array is n + 1 and every value in the array will be between 1 and n. In our example we have 5 elements, and the range is from 1 to 4.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s make some changes. Instead of using our values, let\u0026rsquo;s use our indices as pointers that will point at some position in our input. You can see that we have a cycle, and that we can represent our indices as a linked list. As for our 0 index, none of the other values will be pointing at index 0 because we have a range between 1 and 4, so 0 is not going to be part of the cycle.\nIn the picture you can see that multiple nodes are pointing to node 2. Our next step will be identifying the beginning of the cycle in our linked list, and it will tell us that the beginning of the cycle is our return value. The way we are going to do it is by applying Floyd\u0026rsquo;s algorithm.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at a slightly different example and visualize the work of Floyd\u0026rsquo;s algorithm. The fast and slow pointers both start at position 0. The slow pointer is going to be shifted by one each iteration. You can see in the picture that we can make 3 jumps using the slow pointer and 3 jumps using the fast pointer, and you can see that 3 is the first position where the two pointers intersect. Finding the first intersection of two pointers was the first phase of Floyd\u0026rsquo;s algorithm.\nOur next step is to leave our slow pointer at the intersection. After that, we are going to create a second slow pointer and put it at the beginning of the array. Then we are going to shift both the first slow pointer and the second pointer one more time until they both intersect.

Explanation When we look at the first example, we can see that we have a singly linked list. The only difference between the given linked list and a regular linked list is that every single node has one extra pointer called random. You can see that it points to different nodes and that pointer can point anywhere. From the description of the problem, we learn that we need to create a deep copy of the given input. Deep copy means that we allocate new memory by creating new nodes. In the first example, we have five nodes in the input, so we need to create five nodes in the output. The problem occurs when we are trying to create random pointers. Let\u0026rsquo;s take the third node for example:\nWe create a clone of the first node, then we create the clone of the second node, and lastly we create a clone of the third node The random pointer at the first node is going to be at null The random pointer of the second node is going to be pointing at the first node As for the random pointer of the third node, it\u0026rsquo;s going to point at the fifth node, but we haven\u0026rsquo;t created a deep copy of the fifth node yet. The question becomes, how can we assign a random pointer before the deep copy has been created?\nThe answer is we are going to use two passes:\nAt the first pass, we are going to create a deep copy of each node without linking them.

If we just try to merge both inputs and find the median, it will take us O(m + n) time, but we know that is not what we were asked to do.\nIn most cases when a problem asks to solve in O(log) time, you need binary search, and that’s exactly the case for this problem.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look closely at the example with input nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], nums2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. We know that we can merge those two arrays and find the median very easily. The median is the middle value, in our case it will be 4, because we know that to the left of the middle value we have six values, and to the right of it we have six values, and the length of the merged array is 13. In case we had a merged array with length 12 (even) elements, we can take two middle-most values, or in other words the right-most value in our left partition and the left-most value in our right partition, and take the average by adding them together and dividing the sum by 2.

We will also need to sort the merged array, so the overall time complexity will be O((n + m)*log(n + m))\nTime/Space complexity Time complexity: O((n + m)*log(n + m)) Space complexity: O(n + m) Where n is the length of nums1 and m is the length of nums2 Binary Search Solution class Solution { func findMedianSortedArrays(_ nums1: [Int], _ nums2: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Double { var A = nums1, B = nums2 if A.count \u0026gt; B.count { swap(\u0026amp;A, \u0026amp;B) } let total = A.count + B.count let half = total / 2 var l = 0 var r = A.count while true { let i = (l + r) / 2 let j = half - i let Aleft = i \u0026gt; 0 ?

The way we are going to do it is by partitioning our arrays.\nInitially, we are going to find the total number of elements of both arrays and the half value. Next, we are going to initialize our left and right pointers at the start and end of the array accordingly Next, we are going to find our middle value Next, we are going to find our left partition that will contain 3 elements. As for our second array, we do not need to run binary search on that, because if we run binary search on the first array we can compute the size of the left partition of the second array. We can do this by subtracting our calculated half value with the length of the current partition. Now we need to figure out if we found the correct left partition. The way we are going to do it is by finding out if they are in sorted order.\nWe can do this by checking if the right-most value in the second array is greater than or equal to the left-most value of the first array in the right part of the partition. We also want to know if the right-most value in the first array\u0026rsquo;s left partition is less than or equal to the left-most value of the second array\u0026rsquo;s right partition. In our case the condition is true, and it tells us that our left partition has been done correctly In case we had the left-most value in the right partition in the second array greater than the left-most value of the right partition in the first array, we would find the minimum value between those two The previous example did not show some edge cases. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at an example with a total of 12 elements. The length of the first array is 4 therefore the middle = 2, and the left portion has a size of 2\nThe size of the left partition in the second array will be half - size of left partition in the first array (6 - 2 = 4) Now let\u0026rsquo;s check if we have done the left partition correctly. We are going to compare our right-most value with the left-most value, and check if the condition left-most value \u0026lt;= right-most value is satisfied Next we are going to compare the right-most value with the left-most value and check if the condition right-most value \u0026lt;= left-most value is satisfied. In our case it\u0026rsquo;s not true because the condition 4 \u0026lt;= 3 is not true and it tells us that we need to update our pointers Next we are going to recompute our middle pointer, and our left partitions in both arrays, and check if we partitioned them correctly, by following the same steps as we did before. To avoid the edge case when the first array is empty, we will be using Int.max and Int.min values as default values.\nTime/Space complexity Time complexity: O(log(min(n, m))) Space complexity: O(1) Where n is the length of nums1 and m is the length of nums2 Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-150-median-of-two-sorted-arrays/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven two sorted arrays \u003ccode\u003enums1\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003enums2\u003c/code\u003e of size \u003ccode\u003em\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003en\u003c/code\u003e respectively, return \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median\"\u003ethe median\u003c/a\u003e of the two sorted arrays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe overall run time complexity should be \u003ccode\u003eO(log (m+n))\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"examples\"\u003eExamples\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]\nOutput: 2.00000\nExplanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]\nOutput: 2.50000\nExplanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"constraints\"\u003eConstraints\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003enums1.length == m\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003enums2.length == n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e0 \u0026lt;= m \u0026lt;= 1000\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e0 \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 1000\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1 \u0026lt;= m + n \u0026lt;= 2000\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e-10^6 \u0026lt;= nums1[i], nums2[i] \u0026lt;= 10^6\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"explanation\"\u003eExplanation\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom our given examples we can learn that we could potentially have an even or odd number of total elements after we merge two input arrays.\nIf we just try to merge both inputs and find the median, it will take us O(m + n) time, but we know that is not what we were asked to do.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - 150 - Median of Two Sorted Arrays"},{"content":"The problem Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different timestamps and retrieve the key\u0026rsquo;s value at a certain timestamp.\nImplement the TimeMap class:\nTimeMap() Initializes the object of the data structure. void set(String key, String value, int timestamp) Stores the key key with the value value at the given time timestamp.

At most 2 * 10^5 calls will be made to set and get. Explanation Our objective for this task is to design a key-value store. We are going to have a key, and a list of values associated with that key, and each value is going to have a timestamp associated with it. As for operations, we are going to support only set and get operations. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s look at our example we are going to set, foo as our key, and [bar, 1] as our value next, we are going to get value by key = “foo” and timestamp = 1, so we will be returning value \u0026quot;bar\u0026quot; We will be solving this problem by using a hashmap. Our key will be our actual key that is given to us as an input, and our value will be a list of pairs (value, timestamp). To find our result we will be iterating over the list of pair values. Let\u0026rsquo;s move to our second get operation\nwe are given key = \u0026quot;foo\u0026quot;, and timestamp = 3, so we are going to go to the same list as we did before. You can see that we don\u0026rsquo;t have a value with timestamp = 3, but we are not going to return nil, because of how this problem is defined. The problem does not want to find an exact match; instead, we need to find and return the most recent one. By recent, they mean the closest result (timestamp_prev \u0026lt;= timestamp).\nNext, we will continue doing the same steps as we did above until we complete all of our operations. The set operation will always take O(1) time, but for the get operation we can do it in multiple ways and with different time complexity.\nBrute Force Solution class TimeMap { private var store: [String: [(String, Int)]] init() { self.store = [:] } func set(_ key: String, _ value: String, _ timestamp: Int) { if self.store[key] == nil { self.store[key] = [] } self.store[key]!.append((value, timestamp)) } func get(_ key: String, _ timestamp: Int) -\u0026gt; String { var res = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; let values = self.store[key] ?? [] for value in values { if value.1 \u0026lt;= timestamp { res = value.0 } } return res } } Explanation One way to solve this problem is to just iterate over the list of all pairs and find the closest one. This solution will take O(n), but we know that we are searching for values, so we can use binary search that will take O(logn) time.\nTime/Space complexity Time complexity: O(1) for set operation, O(n) for get operation Space complexity: O(m*n) where n is the total number of unique timestamps associated with a key, and m is the total number of keys Binary Search Solution class TimeMap { private var store: [String: [(String, Int)]] init() { self.store = [:] } func set(_ key: String, _ value: String, _ timestamp: Int) { if self.store[key] == nil { self.store[key] = [] } self.store[key]!.append((value, timestamp)) } func get(_ key: String, _ timestamp: Int) -\u0026gt; String { var res = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; let values = self.store[key] ?? [] var l = 0 var r = values.count - 1 while l \u0026lt;= r { let m = (l + r) / 2 if values[m].1 \u0026lt;= timestamp { res = values[m].0 l = m + 1 } else { r = m - 1 } } return res } } Explanation A more optimal way to solve this problem is to use binary search. We can use it without additional sorting because in the constraints section they mention that All timestamps of set operation are strictly increasing, so we do not need to sort it.\nTime/Space complexity Time complexity: O(1) for set operation, and O(logn) for get operation Space complexity: O(m*n) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-150-time-based-key-value-store/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesign a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different timestamps and retrieve the key\u0026rsquo;s value at a certain timestamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImplement the \u003ccode\u003eTimeMap\u003c/code\u003e class:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ccode\u003eTimeMap()\u003c/code\u003e Initializes the object of the data structure.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ccode\u003evoid set(String key, String value, int timestamp)\u003c/code\u003e Stores the key \u003ccode\u003ekey\u003c/code\u003e with the value \u003ccode\u003evalue\u003c/code\u003e at the given time \u003ccode\u003etimestamp\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ccode\u003eString get(String key, int timestamp)\u003c/code\u003e Returns a value such that \u003ccode\u003eset\u003c/code\u003e was called previously, with \u003ccode\u003etimestamp_prev \u0026lt;= timestamp\u003c/code\u003e.

There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.\nKoko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile.

The brute force way is to start from k = 1.\nThis way Koko can only eat 3 / 1 = 3, plus 6 / 1 = 6, that will be 9 and it\u0026rsquo;s more than h = 8, so this way Koko can only eat one pile.\nWe know that the minimum k value can only be 1 because that would mean that Koko is barely eating any piles.\nAs for the maximum value for k, it will be the maximum value in our input array.\nTo solve this problem, we are going to try to iterate over k in the range 1 … max(piles), and we will continue until we find our value that allows us to eat every single pile in less than or equal to our h value.\nThe time complexity for this solution will be O(m*n).\nBut why should we iterate over every single element in the k range when we have our target h, and we can apply binary search algorithm and optimize our solution?\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(m*n) Space complexity: O(1) where m is the length of the input array and n is the maximum number of bananas in a pile.

Next, we compute the middle pointer, and our k. So for middle value 6, our rate of eating bananas will be 6 and our res value will be 6. We are not going to stop because we are looking for the minimum k value. Now, we can discard all elements on the right side, and only look at the left side. Our middle pointer will be at value 3, and the rate of eating bananas will be 3/3 + 6/3 + 7/3 + 11/3 = 10. The rate is greater than our h, so we are going to update our left and middle pointers. Next, we repeat the steps we did before and calculate the rate that will result in value 8. So at this point our middle pointer is at 4, and our result is 6, so we can update it to 4. Lastly, we are going to stop our binary search and return the result because if we continue, we will be searching values that we already crossed out.

The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row. Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false otherwise.\nYou must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time complexity.\nExamples Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3 Output: true Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13 Output: false Constraints m == matrix.length n == matrix[i].length 1 \u0026lt;= m, n \u0026lt;= 100 -10^4 \u0026lt;= matrix[i][j], target \u0026lt;= 10^4 Explanation From the description of the problem, we learn that each row is sorted and the next row is going to be greater than the previous one. Therefore, each number throughout the matrix is going to be in sorted order. The brute-force way to solve this problem is to search every single value in our input. This algorithm will take O(m * n) time.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at another solution assuming that we just had a single row, and it was in sorted order. We know that the most optimal algorithm that can search for a target would be binary search because we can do search in O(logn) time.\nWe can do it by running binary search on every single row until we find our target. This way we can satisfy the first property from our description. The time complexity for this solution will be O(m * logn), but we can do better and optimize it even further.\nWe can optimize it further by following the second property. By knowing the fact that the next first row will be greater than the last integer in the previous row, we can apply binary search to determine in which row we can find our potential target.\nIf values in our current row are greater than our target, we will be crossing out the current row and will be looking at the row above the current row, because the top row will have smaller values than the bottom row. This approach is more efficient because the first binary search will search for the row and will take O(logm) time, and the second binary search will search for the target value inside the row and will take O(logn) time. So the overall time complexity is O(logm + logn).\nBinary Search Solution func searchMatrix(_ matrix: [[Int]], _ target: Int) -\u0026gt; Bool { let rows = matrix.count let cols = matrix[0].count var topRow = 0 var bottomRow = rows - 1 while topRow \u0026lt;= bottomRow { let m = (bottomRow + topRow) / 2 if matrix[m].last! \u0026lt; target { topRow = m + 1 } else if matrix[m][0] \u0026gt; target { bottomRow = m - 1 } else { break } } let row = (bottomRow + topRow) / 2 var l = 0 var r = cols - 1 while l \u0026lt;= r { let m = (l + r) / 2 if matrix[row][m] \u0026lt; target { l = m + 1 } else if matrix[row][m] \u0026gt; target { r = m - 1 } else { return true } } return false } Time/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(logm + logn), which reduces to O(logm * n) Space complexity: O(1) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns of the matrix Binary Search (One Pass) Solution func searchMatrix(_ matrix: [[Int]], _ target: Int) -\u0026gt; Bool { let rows = matrix.count let cols = matrix[0].count var l = 0 var r = rows * cols - 1 while l \u0026lt;= r { let m = (l + r) / 2 let row = m / cols let col = m % cols if matrix[row][col] \u0026lt; target { l = m + 1 } else if matrix[row][col] \u0026gt; target { r = m - 1 } else { return true } } return false } Time/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(logm * n) Space complexity: O(1) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns of the matrix Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-150-search-a-2d-matrix/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are given an \u003ccode\u003em x n\u003c/code\u003e integer matrix \u003ccode\u003ematrix\u003c/code\u003e with the following two properties:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach row is sorted in non-decreasing order.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven an integer \u003ccode\u003etarget\u003c/code\u003e, return \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e if \u003ccode\u003etarget\u003c/code\u003e is in \u003ccode\u003ematrix\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou must write a solution in \u003ccode\u003eO(log(m * n))\u003c/code\u003e time complexity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"examples\"\u003eExamples\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-f9a47\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-f9a47\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/mat.jpg#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3  \nOutput: true  \n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-7112f\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-7112f\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/mat2.jpg#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - 150 - Search a 2D Matrix"},{"content":"The problem Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums.

The main requirement for binary search is that the input must be sorted.\nFrom the description of the problem, we learn that our input is already sorted, so we do not need to do that.\nAs for the algorithm, we are going to have two pointers l and r, that we initialize at the start and end of the input accordingly.\nWe can’t look only to the leftmost or the rightmost values because we are eliminating only one possibility, and we still need to look at the rest of them. But if we look at the midway point, we can compare it with the target and check if it is smaller than the target or if it is larger than the target:\nIf it is smaller than the target, then everything to the left is also going to be smaller than the target. Now we can shift our left pointer and update it to the value of mid + 1. After that, we are going to repeat the steps we just did. We are going to check if our value at the mid index equals the target, and it does, so we are going to return that index.

The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units. Input: heights = [2,4] Output: 4 Constraints 1 \u0026lt;= heights.length \u0026lt;= 10^5 0 \u0026lt;= heights[i] \u0026lt;= 10^4 Explanation Before we jump to the solution, let\u0026rsquo;s visualize the problem with Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3] After we calculated the area, you can see that the largest rectangle has an area 10. Now let\u0026rsquo;s figure out why it works this way. If we just draw the first two elements, we can see the pattern that with rectangle with height 2, once we reached the 1, we can\u0026rsquo;t extend it any further, because 1 \u0026lt; 2 and we have a hole. For rectangle with value 1, we can extend it towards the left and use the left rectangle. Now let\u0026rsquo;s look at an example when the 1 comes first In this case, we can keep extending it to the right because nothing is stopping us. In case if two rectangles are even, we can extend it to the right too. After analyzing all cases from above, we can conclude that current heights will be in increasing order.\nStack Solution func largestRectangleArea(_ heights: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { var maxArea = 0 var stack: [(Int, Int)] = [] for (i, h) in heights.enumerated() { var start = i while !stack.isEmpty \u0026amp;\u0026amp; stack.last!.1 \u0026gt; h { let (index, height) = stack.removeLast() maxArea = max(maxArea, height * (i - index)) start = index } stack.append((start, h)) } for (i, h) in stack { maxArea = max(maxArea, h * (heights.count - i)) } return maxArea } Explanation To solve this problem, we will be using a stack. We will be looking for increasing heights and where increasing stopped. If we found the rectangle that cannot be extended, we will compute the area and pop the element. For example, input with heights = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2] You can see that we can\u0026rsquo;t extend rectangle with value 4 any further, so we will compute the area and pop 4. We also cannot extend rectangle with value 3, so we need to compute the area and pop it as well. As for rectangle with value 2, we can extend it because the rightmost value to it is also 2. So in this example, we only need to remove values 3 and 4.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s look at the algorithm.\nWe start at index 0, and add height 2 to our stack Next, we get to index 1, and add height 1 to our stack, but you can see that we have height 1 at the top of our stack, and we can\u0026rsquo;t extend area with height 2 any further. The max area that we have so far is two, because our width is one, and our height is two, and now we can pop rectangle with value 2 from our stack. We can also extend rectangle at index one to the left, so index for this height will be zero Next, we are going to get to index two and height 5, five is greater than one and it can be extended, so we are going to add it to our stack Next, we get to index three, and again, height 6 is greater than 5, so we are going to add it to our stack Next, at index four we have height 2, and we can\u0026rsquo;t extend previous rectangle with height 6 any further, therefore we need to compute the area and pop it Now, the top value in our stack has height 5, and it is also greater than 2, so we need to compute the area, and pop it. As for start index for rectangle with height 2, we can extend backwards to the index two, because we just popped two elements Lastly, we reach our index five with height 3, so we put it into our stack, and we do not need to pop previous value 2, because 3 \u0026gt; 2, and we can continue extending. As for start index, we can\u0026rsquo;t extend backwards anymore so it will be 5 At this point, we have three values that are still in our stack, and we need to compute areas for these heights\nAt index five and height 3, it started and went all the way to the end of the histogram, that means that the length for it is just 1, and we can compute the area of 3. The area of 3 is not greater than our current maximum of 10, so we don\u0026rsquo;t update our max At the next index of 2, we have height 2, so this means that the area starts from index 2, and went all the way to the end of histogram. This means that width was 4 and height was 2, so the computed area equals 8. The calculated area is not greater than 10, so we don\u0026rsquo;t update our max area At the last area of our stack with index 0, and height 1, tells us that it started at index 0 and went all the way to the end of the histogram, so the width will be 6, the height was 1, so the calculated area equals 6, this area is not greater than our current value of 10, so we do not update max area Time/Space complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-150-largest-rectangle-in-histogram/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven an array of integers \u003ccode\u003eheights\u003c/code\u003e representing the histogram\u0026rsquo;s bar height where the width of each bar is \u003ccode\u003e1\u003c/code\u003e, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"examples\"\u003eExamples\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-f3e90\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-f3e90\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/histogram.jpg#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]  \nOutput: 10  \nExplanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.  \nThe largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.  \n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-1deaf\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-1deaf\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/histogram-1.jpg#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - 150 - Largest Rectangle in Histogram"},{"content":"The problem There are n cars at given miles away from the starting mile 0, traveling to reach the mile target.\nYou are given two integer array position and speed, both of length n, where position[i] is the starting mile of the ith car and speed[i] is the speed of the ith car in miles per hour.\nA car cannot pass another car, but it can catch up and then travel next to it at the speed of the slower car.\nA car fleet is a car or cars driving next to each other.

The first car is traveling with speed 10 miles per hour and it\u0026rsquo;s first in the line. The second car is traveling with speed 20 miles per hour and it\u0026rsquo;s second in the line. The faster car will eventually catch up and will be travelling with the same speed as the first car because the road has a single line. When the faster car catches up, its speed will be reduced to the speed of the slower one. Once cars are traveling next to each other, that is called a car fleet and cars are assumed to have the same exact position. Stack Solution func carFleet(_ target: Int, _ position: [Int], _ speed: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { let pair = zip(position, speed).sorted { $0.0 \u0026gt; $1.0 } var stack: [Double] = [] for (p, s) in pair { stack.append(Double(target - p) / Double(s)) if stack.count \u0026gt;= 2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; stack[stack.count - 1] \u0026lt;= stack[stack.count - 2] { stack.removeLast() } } return stack.count } Explanation Let\u0026rsquo;s look at another example with [position, speed] = [[3, 3], [5, 2], [7, 1]] We start with position 3 and speed 3:\nAt one second, it will be at position 6; at two seconds, it will be at position 9; and at three seconds, it will be at position 12. Next, the position starts at 5 and speed 2:\nAt one second, it will be at position 7; at two seconds, it will be at position 9; and at three seconds, it will be at position 11. Lastly, we have position 7 and speed 1:\nAt one second, it will be at position 8; at two seconds, it will be at position 9; and at three seconds, it will be at position 10. You can see that lines intersect. It tells us that they are going to be a fleet. You can also see that the blue line intersects with the orange line before the green line does, meaning that it will be traveling with the same rate as the orange one.\nNow when we know the idea, we can get into the solution to this problem. One way to solve this problem is to calculate intersections, but more easier way would be to determine in what time cars are going to reach their destination.\nIf the car with position 5 reaches the destination before or at the same time as the position 7, this means that they become a car fleet. We know at what speed each car is traveling, so we can calculate the time when they will reach the destination.\nTo do that, we will take our target, subtract the position, and divide it by the speed. After calculation, you can see that cars at position 5 and 7 are going to collide. Now we can delete a car.\nWe are going to remove the car that is not ahead, because when the cars collide, the speed is going to be reduced to the car that is ahead. We are going to look from right to left because, if we go from left to right, we do not know at what speed the blue car is going to travel, and we can\u0026rsquo;t assume that the car is going to travel with the same speed and will not collide with somebody else and slow down. We will be using a stack to solve this problem:\nInitially, our stack is going to be empty We are going to go through elements in reverse order We are going to add the first car to our stack Next, we are going to take the next car and add it to the top of the stack Then we are going to compare both cars to see if they collide with each other Then we are going to remove the car that is on top of the stack Next steps will be the same as above Time/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(n*logn) Space complexity: O(n) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-150-car-fleet/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are \u003ccode\u003en\u003c/code\u003e cars at given miles away from the starting mile 0, traveling to reach the mile \u003ccode\u003etarget\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are given two integer array \u003ccode\u003eposition\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003espeed\u003c/code\u003e, both of length \u003ccode\u003en\u003c/code\u003e, where \u003ccode\u003eposition[i]\u003c/code\u003e is the starting mile of the \u003ccode\u003eith\u003c/code\u003e car and \u003ccode\u003espeed[i]\u003c/code\u003e is the speed of the \u003ccode\u003eith\u003c/code\u003e car in miles per hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA car cannot pass another car, but it can catch up and then travel next to it at the speed of the slower car.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - 150 - Car Fleet"},{"content":"The problem Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature.

In the first example, we can see that we can calculate how many days in the input array it takes us to find a temperature that is greater than 73.\nWe can see that on the next day we have temperature 74 that is greater than 73, so it took us one day We will need one day to find a temperature that is greater than 74, because the next day contains temperature 75 We will need four days to get the next value that is greater than 75 For the last two positions, we will return 0 because nothing to the right is greater than 76 and there is no temperature to the right after 73 Brute force Solution func dailyTemperatures(_ temperatures: [Int]) -\u0026gt; [Int] { let n = temperatures.count var res: [Int] = [] for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; n { var count = 1 var j = i + 1 while j \u0026lt; n { if temperatures[j] \u0026gt; temperatures[i] { break } j += 1 count += 1 } if j == n { count = 0 } res.append(count) } return res } Explanation The brute force way to solve this problem is to look at every temperature and scan through the entire temperature array\nfind out how many days it will take us to find a temperature that is greater than the current one. We will need to do the same thing for every temperature until we have looked through all elements in the array. This solution will take O(n^2) time complexity, but there is a more optimal way to solve it if we use extra memory.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(n^2) Space complexity: O(1) extra space, O(n) space for the output array Stack Solution func dailyTemperatures(_ temperatures: [Int]) -\u0026gt; [Int] { let n = temperatures.count var res: [Int] = Array(repeating: 0, count: n) var stack: [[Int]] = [] for (i, t) in temperatures.enumerated() { while !stack.isEmpty \u0026amp;\u0026amp; t \u0026gt; stack.last![0] { let val = stack.removeLast() let stackT = val[0] let stackIdx = val[1] res[stackIdx] = (i - stackIdx) } stack.append([t, i]) } return res } Explanation From the solution above, we learn that we can solve this problem in a more optimal way using a stack. To do that, we need to know the previous temperatures that we looked at.\nIf we find a temperature that is greater than the current temperature in our stack, we will find the difference, add it to our output, and remove the smallest temperature from our stack. In case we have a temperature that is less than the top temperature in our stack, we can\u0026rsquo;t remove the value from our stack; instead, we will add the next value.

In the example section, you can see that for each left parenthesis we have a matching right parenthesis that comes after it at some point. The n = 3 means that we have three pairs.

We can have another open ( parenthesis because our limit is 3 open parentheses, and so far we have two. What if we wanted to add a closing ) parenthesis instead of an open (? We can do it because at this point we have only one open parenthesis, and zero closed, but when we add a closed parenthesis, the close count also changes to one. You can see that we keep count of our open and closed parentheses, which helps us add an open parenthesis only when the condition close \u0026lt; open is satisfied. When we add a parenthesis, we update our counters.\nWe can solve this problem by using a backtracking algorithm.\nWe will be keeping track of how many open and closed parentheses are left And check if the condition close \u0026lt; open is satisfied In the picture, you can see how the algorithm will generate the result, with three of each parenthesis and valid ordering.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(4^n/sqrt(n)) Space complexity: O(n) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-150-generate-parentheses/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven \u003ccode\u003en\u003c/code\u003e pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"examples\"\u003eExamples\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: n = 3  \nOutput: [\u0026#34;((()))\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;(()())\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;(())()\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;()(())\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;()()()\u0026#34;]\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: n = 1  \nOutput: [\u0026#34;()\u0026#34;]\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"constraints\"\u003eConstraints\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1 \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 8\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"explanation\"\u003eExplanation\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we jump to the solution, let\u0026rsquo;s figure out what \u003cstrong\u003ewell-formed parentheses\u003c/strong\u003e mean.\nIn this problem, this means when you\u0026rsquo;re writing the code using nested parentheses, you want them to be nested in a valid way, like \u003ccode\u003e(()())\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - 150 - Generate Parentheses"},{"content":"The problem You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.\nEvaluate the expression.

Explanation Before we jump into the solution, let\u0026rsquo;s look at our example from the description we push value -2 next, we push value 0 next, we push value -3 Now we want to getMin. The brute-force way to do this is to look into every single value and find the min value.

But in the problem description, we see that we need to solve it in O(1) time. To do that, we can try to create a single variable that will track our minimum The problem with this approach occurs when the popped element is the minimum. Now we don\u0026rsquo;t know what the new minimum is A good workaround to this problem is to store the current minimum at each position, so when we pop, we will know our new minimum You can see that we defined another stack:\none stack tells us the order and values that we added so far the other stack tells us what the minimum values are that we added so far in each position of the stack if we add a value, we will be inserting into both stacks if we pop a value, we will be popping from both stacks Time/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(1) for all operations Space complexity: O(n) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-150-min-stack/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesign a stack that supports \u003ccode\u003epush\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003epop\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003etop\u003c/code\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eretrieving the minimum element in constant time\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImplement the \u003ccode\u003eMinStack\u003c/code\u003e class:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ccode\u003eMinStack()\u003c/code\u003e initializes the stack object.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ccode\u003evoid push(int val)\u003c/code\u003e pushes the element \u003ccode\u003eval\u003c/code\u003e onto the stack.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ccode\u003evoid pop()\u003c/code\u003e removes the element on the top of the stack.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ccode\u003eint top()\u003c/code\u003e gets the top element of the stack.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ccode\u003eint getMin()\u003c/code\u003e retrieves the minimum element in the stack.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou must implement a solution with \u003ccode\u003eO(1)\u003c/code\u003e time complexity for each function.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - 150 - Min Stack"},{"content":"The problem You are given an array of integers nums, and there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right.

At the next position, we see that our max value is 5, which we put in our output. You might recognize one solution to this problem immediately, by finding max in the window array.\nBrute Force Solution func maxSlidingWindow(_ nums: [Int], _ k: Int) -\u0026gt; [Int] { var res: [Int] = [] let n = nums.count for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; n - k + 1 { var maxVal = nums[i] for j in i ..\u0026lt; i + k { maxVal = max(maxVal, nums[j]) } res.append(maxVal) } return res } Explanation Above we learn that we can solve this problem in a brute force way by going through each window and scanning through the array and finding the max value. This solution is not very efficient because we have repetitive work when we scan the array. But we can optimize it even further and get O(n) time.\nTime / Space complexity Time complexity: O(k * n) Space complexity: O(1) extra space, O(n - k + 1) for the output array Where k is the size of the window, and n is the length of the input array.

If we have a window and we see a value that is greater than the previous values in our window, then we can eliminate those values from our window. We can do this by using the Deque data structure. Values in deque are always going to be in decreasing order. Since value 4 is greater than the rightmost position in our deque, we can pop it.\nAfter that, we are going to make a comparison again. Value 4 is still at the top of our deque, so we are going to pop it. We will continue popping until we have popped all elements. Next, we will add value 4 to our output. Now, we shift our window by one position, and we introduce a new element 5.\nWe need to check if 5 is greater than the value at the top of our deque. After the comparison, we see that 4 \u0026lt; 5, so we remove value 4 from our deque and add value 5. We also add value 5 to our output. This solution is more efficient because adding and removing elements from a deque takes O(1) time, so the overall time complexity will be O(n).\nThis type of problem is called a monotonic decreasing queue. The reason behind this is that our queue is always going to be in decreasing order.\nTime / Space complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-150-sliding-window-maximum/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are given an array of integers \u003ccode\u003enums\u003c/code\u003e, and there is a sliding window of size \u003ccode\u003ek\u003c/code\u003e which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right.

We are also going to have a hashmap for s2 which will contain only the characters of the current window. So, every time we create a window, we only add the new character and maybe remove the character that was on the left. Once we have those hashmaps, we are going to compare them to check if they are equal. This solution will take O(n * m) time complexity, but we can optimize it further and get O(n) time.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(n * m) Space complexity: O(m) Where n is the length of string2, and m is the length of string1.

The difference between this solution and the previous one is that we are not going to compare two hashmaps directly. Instead, we are going to keep track of one more variable, matches.\nThe matches variable maintains the total number of equal character counts in both hashmaps.\nSo, the first thing we do is look at the first few characters and fill up our s2Count hashmap.\nAfter we fill our hashmaps, we iterate through both hashmaps comparing each character. Next, we can see that both hashmaps have matches because they both have zero ds, es, fs, etc. They all match every single character except for c and x. Therefore, we initially have 24 matches. Next, we shift our window one character to the right.\nWhen we shift, we remove the b character from the s2Count hashmap. Now, changing the count of b in s2Count to 0 means it no longer matches the b count in the s1Count hashmap. Therefore, our matches total is updated to 23. We also added a new character y, which affects our matches because in s1Count we have zero ys. This means we created a mismatch and need to decrease our matches by 1, making the total number of matches = 22. Next, we continue moving our window and repeat the operations above until we reach 26 matches, at which point we stop the algorithm and return true, or until we reach the end of string2, in which case we return false.\nWe also return false if string2 is shorter than string1.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(1) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-150-permutation-in-string/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven two strings \u003ccode\u003es1\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003es2\u003c/code\u003e, return \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e if \u003ccode\u003es2\u003c/code\u003e contains a permutation of \u003ccode\u003es1\u003c/code\u003e, or \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA permutation is a rearrangement of all the characters of a string.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, return \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e if one of \u003ccode\u003es1\u003c/code\u003e’s permutations is a substring of \u003ccode\u003es2\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"examples\"\u003eExamples\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: s1 = \u0026#34;ab\u0026#34;, s2 = \u0026#34;eidbaooo\u0026#34;\nOutput: true\nExplanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 (\u0026#34;ba\u0026#34;).\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: s1 = \u0026#34;ab\u0026#34;, s2 = \u0026#34;eidboaoo\u0026#34;\nOutput: false\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"constraints\"\u003eConstraints\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1 \u0026lt;= s1.length, s2.length \u0026lt;= 10^4\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003es1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"explanation\"\u003eExplanation\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we jump into the solution, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the example with input \u003ccode\u003es1 = \u0026quot;ab\u0026quot;, s2 = \u0026quot;eidbaooo\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-7d24f\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-7d24f\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/567.png#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are looking for a permutation of \u003ccode\u003es1\u003c/code\u003e in \u003ccode\u003es2\u003c/code\u003e with the size of \u003ccode\u003es1\u003c/code\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the example, we can see that we have a permutation of \u003ccode\u003es1 = \u0026quot;ab\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e in \u003ccode\u003es2 = \u0026quot;eidbaooo\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e but in a different order.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - 150 - Permutation in String"},{"content":"The problem Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.\nExamples Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1] Output: 6 Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5] Output: 9 Constraints n == height.length 1 \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 2 * 10^4 0 \u0026lt;= height[i] \u0026lt;= 10^5 Explanation Let\u0026rsquo;s look at our example and determine the algorithm of how much water each position could trap.\nIn the picture, you can see that no matter how much water you put at the position of zero, it will spill out because there are no boundaries on the left. The same goes for position one, because no matter how much water you put on top of the block with height 1, it\u0026rsquo;s not going to trap water, since there is no boundary to its left and the water is going to spill out. In the third position, we have one block of water. If we try to add a second block of water, we can see that we have a right boundary of 2 on the right, but on the left side we only have a boundary with height 1, meaning that water will spill out. So we see that the height on the right is 2, and the height on the left is 1, so we need to take the minimum of 1 and 2 - (min(1, 2)). Prefix \u0026amp; Suffix Arrays Solution func trap(_ height: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { let n = height.count if n == 0 { return 0 } var leftMax = Array(repeating: 0, count: n) var rightMax = Array(repeating: 0, count: n) leftMax[0] = height[0] for i in 1 ..\u0026lt; n { leftMax[i] = max(leftMax[i - 1], height[i]) } rightMax[n - 1] = height[n - 1] for i in stride(from: n - 2, to: -1, by: -1) { rightMax[i] = max(rightMax[i + 1], height[i]) } var res = 0 for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; n { res += min(leftMax[i], rightMax[i]) - height[i] } return res } Explanation Above, we discussed our bottleneck (how much water we were able to trap) for every single position.\nWe need the max height on the left and max height on the right, and we need to take the minimum of those two. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the position of 3.\nWe can’t trap any water here, because when you look at the right section, the maximum height is 3. When you look at the left section, the maximum height there is 1. The calculation will look like this:\nWe are going to take the minimum of the left height and right height and subtract the current height (min(L, R) - h[i]). This will help us determine how much water we can trap at position i. If, for example, we have L = 1, R = 3, and current height h[i] = 2, the result will be min(L, R) - h[i] = -1. The negative value tells us that we can trap zero water at position h[i]. We will continue to use this calculation to get the appropriate water count, and when we take the sum of all the calculated values, we will get our result.\nNow we can dive into the implementation.\nSince for every single position, to know how much water we can trap at index i, we need to know what the max left and right heights are at every single position. We can make an array and store the calculation for us.\nTo do that:\nWe are going to scan through the entire array, calculating every single maxLeft position. We are also going to calculate maxRight in reverse order. Lastly, we are going to take the minimum of max left and max right, because the minimum is going to help us determine how much water is trapped at a specific position. So now, for every single position, we are going to determine how much water we can trap. We can do it with our calculation: min(L, R) - h[i].\nThis solution will take O(n) time and space complexity. It\u0026rsquo;s a very efficient solution, but we can optimize it even further by reducing memory.\nTime/Space complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Solution func trap(_ height: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { let n = height.count if n == 0 { return 0 } var l = 0 var r = n - 1 var res = 0 var leftMax = height[l] var rightMax = height[r] while l \u0026lt; r { if leftMax \u0026lt; rightMax { l += 1 leftMax = max(leftMax, height[l]) res += leftMax - height[l] } else { r -= 1 rightMax = max(rightMax, height[r]) res += rightMax - height[r] } } return res } Explanation From the previous solution, we learn that we can get rid of extra memory by using the two-pointer technique.\nWe are going to have a left pointer at the beginning of the array, and a right pointer at the end of the array. We are also going to have two variables: maxLeft and maxRight, which are going to keep track of the max of the left pointer and max of the right pointer. Now we are going to update our pointers. We are going to shift the pointer that has the smaller max value. When our maxLeft and maxRight are equal, it does not matter which pointer we shift, so we can choose one of them. We continue calculating our result by shifting pointers. At height 2, we are going to update our right pointer because our maxL value is greater than maxR. After that, our maxL and maxR are equal again, and we will be updating the left pointer. We will continue doing this operation until the condition left \u0026lt; right is no longer satisfied.

We will continue summing values until we reach a sum that is more than our target, and this also means that we don’t have to look at the remaining numbers in the array, because every next number will be greater than the target. We are going to follow this algorithm with other values until we have tried all possible combinations.

Then we eliminated 10. So we are basically eliminating elements from the end of the array in reverse order, and we can use this to our advantage. Let’s try the same problem but with a slightly different algorithm.\nWe can use two pointers where the left pointer is going to be at the beginning of the array, and the right pointer is going to be at the end of the array.\nNow we are going to sum the values at those pointers:\nWe currently have values 1 and 11, and sum = 12, which is greater than our target. Since sum is too big, we need to decrease our right pointer, because if we choose to increase our left pointer, we will be increasing sum. Next, we recompute our sum, which will be 11, and we will decrease our right pointer again. Next, we will have a sum of 8, which is less than our target, and then we will increment our left pointer. Lastly, we recompute our sum again, where we find our result.

Since there are two 8\u0026#39;s in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid. Constraints board.length == 9 board[i].length == 9 board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or \u0026lsquo;.\u0026rsquo;. Explanation From description of the problem we learn that row must contain digits 1-9 without repetition. The same goes for column, this means that we can\u0026rsquo;t have duplicates in any particular row or column. The last rule tells us that our sub-boxes 3x3 should contain digits 1-9 without repetition.\nOur Sudoku board does not necessarily have to be filled in, and it can have only values without any duplicates.\nSolution func isValidSudoku(_ board: [[Character]]) -\u0026gt; Bool { var rows: [Int: Set\u0026lt;Character\u0026gt;] = [:] var cols: [Int: Set\u0026lt;Character\u0026gt;] = [:] var squares: [IndexHelper: Set\u0026lt;Character\u0026gt;] = [:] for r in 0 ..\u0026lt; 9 { for c in 0 ..\u0026lt; 9 { if board[r][c] == \u0026#34;.\u0026#34; { continue } if ( rows[r, default: []].contains(board[r][c]) || cols[c, default: []].contains(board[r][c]) || squares[IndexHelper(r: r / 3, c: c / 3), default: []].contains(board[r][c])) { return false } cols[c, default: []].insert(board[r][c]) rows[r, default: []].insert(board[r][c]) squares[IndexHelper(r: r / 3, c: c / 3), default: []].insert(board[r][c]) } } return true } struct IndexHelper: Hashable { let r: Int let c: Int } Explanation We can solve this problem by going through every single row and make sure that every particular row does not have any duplicates. We will be using hash set for each single row for entire grid to check if we don\u0026rsquo;t have any duplicates.\nAt this point we were able to find a way to follow the first rule and check if row has any duplicates.\nAs for second rule where we need to check every single column we can do the same thing, create a hash set for every column, and then we can determine if there are any duplicates or not.\nFor the third rule we can also use hash set to store 3x3 grid.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try to figure out how we can use hash set in third rule.\nSince we have grid 9x9, the question becomes how do we know that for example value in row = 1 and col = 1 happens to be in particular 3x3 grid, where cell with row = 4 and col = 4 happens to be in different grid.\nNotice that we have sub-squares with size 3x3.\nOne way to find value in sub-squares is to have an index that represents row of different squares, and similarly index that represents column.\nNow the question is how we can convert cell with row = 4 and col = 4, to indices.\nSince we have sub-squares with size 3x3, we are going to take actual index of row 4/3 = 1, similarly we do the same thing to column 4/3 = 1, this way we can uniquely identify that [1, 1] belongs to the middle 3x3 grid.\nFinally, we are going to have hash set where the pair is going to be row / 3, column / 3, and value is going to be hash set where we can tell do we have any duplicates or not.\nWe are going to go through entire grid, if we find any duplicates we return false, if we don\u0026rsquo;t we can return true.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(n^2) Space complexity: O(n^2) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-150-valid-sudoku/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetermine if a \u003ccode\u003e9 x 9\u003c/code\u003e Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach row must contain the digits \u003ccode\u003e1-9\u003c/code\u003e without repetition.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach column must contain the digits \u003ccode\u003e1-9\u003c/code\u003e without repetition.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach of the nine \u003ccode\u003e3 x 3\u003c/code\u003e sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits \u003ccode\u003e1-9\u003c/code\u003e without repetition.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOnly the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"examples\"\u003eExamples\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-334fd\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-334fd\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/Sudoku-by-L2G-20050714.svg.png#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - 150 - Valid Sudoku"},{"content":"The problem Given two integers a and b, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators + and -.\nExamples Input: a = 1, b = 2 Output: 3 Input: a = 2, b = 3 Output: 5 Constraints -1000 \u0026lt;= a, b \u0026lt;= 1000 Explanation From the description of the problem, we learn that we need to figure out the way of adding two numbers without using + or - operators.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s visualize this problem and find the way we can do it.\nWe know that in binary representation of our number we could have 0 and 1.\nNormally, when we use + operator, we have a value in binary, for example a = 1, b = 0, we would get 1 in our output. If binary values in both a = 1, b = 1, are 1s, we would get 0 as result. What we have discovered is logical operator xor - ^ (exclusive or). Basically, it means:\nIf one of a or b has 1, then we will have 1 in the output. If both of a and b are the same, then we will have 0 in the output. So xor works. If we have a = 1 and b = 1, and we do the xor operation, we\u0026rsquo;re going to get a 0 in the output, but we also want a 1 carry.\nWe are going to have a carry only in the case when we have two ones a = 1 and b = 1.\nTo determine if we have a carry, we are going to use the \u0026amp; operator, because by using the \u0026amp; operator on a = 1 and b = 1 we will get 1.\nNow we need to move our carry to the left spot. We can do it by shifting \u0026lt;\u0026lt; to the left by 1.\nNow our solution will look like this: (a \u0026amp; b) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 1\nSummarizing all that we did above:\nWe are going to have a loop Do xor operation If we have a carry value, we are going to shift \u0026lt;\u0026lt; to the left Solution func getSum(_ a: Int, _ b: Int) -\u0026gt; Int { var a = a var b = b while (b != 0) { let tmp = (a \u0026amp; b) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 1 a = a ^ b b = tmp } return a } Explanation Now as we figured out the way how we are going to solve this problem, let\u0026rsquo;s go through an example with a = 9, b = 11:\nWe are going to run xor operation a ^ b bit by bit, and in result we will get 0010. We are also going to run \u0026amp; operation a \u0026amp; b, and shift \u0026lt;\u0026lt; it to the left. That will get 10010. After that, we are going to take the result of the xor operation and the \u0026amp;, and add them together (by doing the same operations as above). We will continue doing these operations until our carry is equal to 0. We do not need to create additional logic for dealing with negative numbers because xor and \u0026amp; operations are equivalent to addition, as long as the language that we are using handles binary representation correctly.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(1) Space complexity: O(1) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-sum-of-two-integers/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven two integers \u003ccode\u003ea\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eb\u003c/code\u003e, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators \u003ccode\u003e+\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003e-\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"examples\"\u003eExamples\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: a = 1, b = 2\nOutput: 3\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: a = 2, b = 3\nOutput: 5\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"constraints\"\u003eConstraints\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e-1000 \u0026lt;= a, b \u0026lt;= 1000\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"explanation\"\u003eExplanation\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the description of the problem, we learn that we need to figure out the way of adding two numbers without using \u003ccode\u003e+\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003e-\u003c/code\u003e operators.\u003cbr\u003e\nLet\u0026rsquo;s visualize this problem and find the way we can do it.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - Blind 75 - Sum of Two Integers"},{"content":"The problem Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.\nExamples Input: nums = [3,0,1] Output: 2 Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

When we have both numbers that are the same, for example 5 and 5, we will get 0 in the output, because the binary representation of these numbers is the same\nThe order in which we do the ^ operation does not matter, because values that are the same cancel each other out.\nNow we are at the point where we can apply the ^ operator and solve this problem.\nWe will be using the example with nums = [3,0,1],\nWe are going to take the range [0, 1, 2, 3], and use the ^ operator on the input array [3, 0, 1].

Our output will look like this: 01 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 1 = 10. Lastly, we are going to convert our binary representation to an int value by using logical | operation:\nIf we have value 0 and we logic | it with 1, we get 1 (0 | 1 = 1) If we take 0 and we logic | it with 0, we get 0 (0 | 0 = 0) Time/Space complexity Time complexity: O(1) Space complexity: O(1) Bit Manipulation Solution func reverseBits(_ n: Int) -\u0026gt; Int { var res = 0 for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; 32 { let bit = (n \u0026gt;\u0026gt; i) \u0026amp; 1 res = res | (bit \u0026lt;\u0026lt; (31 - i)) } return res } Explanation In the previous solution, we used a string that we reversed to get our result, but we can do better by getting rid of the additional string and unnecessary for loop, dealing only with bit manipulations.\nWe are going to use a for loop with range from 0 to 32 exclusive.\nAfter that, we are going to take n, shift it to the right \u0026gt;\u0026gt; by i. This will help us find the target bit, which we will \u0026amp; with 1, so our bit will be 1 or 0. Then we want to logic | our bit with our output to put this bit into the output. We are using logic | with the bit because we are only going to be updating one spot of our result.\nBut we want to update it in reverse order. We want to start from our largest bit and work our way down. We are going to shift our bit to the left \u0026lt;\u0026lt; by 31 - i. At the first iteration of the loop, we will be getting the first bit from n, and we will be putting it into the 31st spot of the result.\nThe time complexity will be O(1) because we are guaranteed that it’s only going to be 32 bits, so the solution does not scale regardless of whatever input n.\nAnd for memory, we are only using a single variable, so it also will be O(1).\nTime/Space complexity Time complexity: O(1) Space complexity: O(1) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-reverse-bits/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReverse bits of a given 32-bit unsigned integer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNote that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type.

Explanation Before jumping into the solution, let’s take a look at an example with input n = 2 and how we can count bits.\nWhen we start counting, we can see that we have three values: 0, 1, 2.\nValue 0 has no leading 1s in binary representation Value 1 has only one 1 bit Value 2 also has only one 1 bit As a result, we return an array with [0, 1, 1].\nBit Manipulation - I Solution func countBits(_ n: Int) -\u0026gt; [Int] { var res: [Int] = [] for num in 0 ..\u0026lt; n + 1 { var one = 0 for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; 32 { if ((num \u0026amp; (1 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; i)) != 0) { one += 1 } } res.append(one) } return res } Explanation Now let’s change our input to 3 -\u0026gt; 011, and find the way we can count multiple 1s.\nWe are going to use \u0026amp; operator, which will help us determine if the current bit is equal to 1.\nWe will also be using the \u0026lt;\u0026lt; shift operator to the right. This way, we can cross out the current bit and find the rest of the bits.\nTime/Space complexity Time complexity: O(n*logn) Space complexity: O(1) extra space, O(n) space for the output array Bit Manipulation (DP) Solution func countBits(_ n: Int) -\u0026gt; [Int] { var dp = Array(repeating: 0, count: n + 1) var offset = 1 for i in 1 ..\u0026lt; n + 1 { if offset * 2 == i { offset = i } dp[i] = 1 + dp[i - offset] } return dp } Explanation Let’s look at the binary representation of 8:\nWe know that 0 has zero 1s in binary representation.\nWhen we get to 1, we have one occurrence of 1 For binary representation of 2, we have one For binary representation of 3, we have two different 1s When you get to value 4, you start to notice how we are doing repetitive work.\nYou can see that for the values from 4 to 7, the first two bits repeat the previous four values that we calculated.\nSo when we want to get the value of 4, we can take the binary representation of 0 and add 1 to its third bit.\nIf you want to get the value of 5, you can take the binary representation of 1 and add a 1 bit to the third bit.\nYou can see that when we calculate how many 1s are in the binary representation of 4, we just say 1 + dp[0] or 1 + dp[n - 4]. This is a dynamic problem because we are using previous results that we calculated to compute the new results.\nWhen we get to the binary representation of 8, our offset is no longer four, because now the binary representation of 8 represents integer 0. So we want to take 8, offset it to eight, which is going to get us to zero.\nFor each value, we are going to have the equation 1 + dp[n - offset], where offset is the most significant bit we have reached so far.\nThe most significant bit is going to be [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, …]. Basically, it doubles in size. We also know that each bit is a power of two—that’s what binary represents.\nLet’s look at how we can calculate our offset:\nWe know that 0 is our base case and it has zero ones.\nWe know that in the next position of one, we reached the most significant bit of 1, therefore our value will be 1 + dp[n - 1]. At the next position of two, we reached the significant bit of 2, so our value will be 1 + dp[n - 2]. At the next position of three, we again have the most significant bit of 2, so it’s going to use the previous value 1 + dp[n - 2]. When we get to the next element of four, we can see that we reached a new power of two, therefore we will be modifying our offset to 1 + dp[n - 4]. Similarly, when we get to eight, we reach a new power of two, so we are going to do 1 + dp[n - 8]. We can detect that we reached a new power of two by multiplying the previous power of two by 2, and comparing it to the current value we are at.\nTime/Space complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(1) extra space, O(n) space for the output array Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-counting-bits/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven an integer \u003ccode\u003en\u003c/code\u003e, return an array \u003ccode\u003eans\u003c/code\u003e of length \u003ccode\u003en + 1\u003c/code\u003e such that for each \u003ccode\u003ei\u003c/code\u003e (\u003ccode\u003e0 \u0026lt;= i \u0026lt;= n\u003c/code\u003e), \u003ccode\u003eans[i]\u003c/code\u003e is the number of \u003ccode\u003e1\u003c/code\u003es in the binary representation of \u003ccode\u003ei\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"examples\"\u003eExamples\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: n = 2  \nOutput: [0,1,1]  \nExplanation:  \n0 --\u0026gt; 0  \n1 --\u0026gt; 1  \n2 --\u0026gt; 10  \n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: n = 5  \nOutput: [0,1,1,2,1,2]  \nExplanation:  \n0 --\u0026gt; 0  \n1 --\u0026gt; 1  \n2 --\u0026gt; 10  \n3 --\u0026gt; 11  \n4 --\u0026gt; 100  \n5 --\u0026gt; 101  \n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"constraints\"\u003eConstraints\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e0 \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 10^5\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollow up:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - Blind 75 - Counting Bits"},{"content":"The problem Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).\nA set bit refers to a bit in the binary representation of a number that has a value of 1.\nExamples Input: n = 11 Output: 3 Explanation: The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

Even when we introduce a bunch of other 1s, this will not affect us because every new 1 bit that we introduced will be on the right side, and they do not matter because we \u0026amp; n with n - 1— they are all going to cancel out.\nBasically, what we did is skip all 0s in between, and we allowed ourselves to run the loop as many times as there are 1 bits in the input.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(1) Space complexity: O(1) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-number-of-1-bits/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven a positive integer \u003ccode\u003en\u003c/code\u003e, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight\"\u003eHamming weight\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA set bit refers to a bit in the binary representation of a number that has a value of 1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"examples\"\u003eExamples\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: n = 11  \nOutput: 3  \nExplanation:  \nThe input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: n = 128  \nOutput: 1  \nExplanation:  \nThe input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: n = 2147483645  \nOutput: 30  \nExplanation:  \nThe input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"constraints\"\u003eConstraints\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1 \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 2^31 - 1\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - Blind 75 - Number of 1 Bits"},{"content":"The problem Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0s.\nYou must do it in place.\nExamples Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]] Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]] Input: matrix = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]] Output: [[0,0,0,0],[0,4,5,0],[0,3,1,0]] Constraints m == matrix.length n == matrix[0].length 1 \u0026lt;= m, n \u0026lt;= 200 -2³¹ \u0026lt;= matrix[i][j] \u0026lt;= 2³¹ - 1 Follow up:\nA straightforward solution using O(m*n) space is probably a bad idea.

Set our column to 0 when we encounter value 0. If we encounter 0 in the middle of the matrix, we are going to set the cell in the first row with the current column to 0, and also set 0 to the cell in the first column with the current row position. This way, we can keep track of which rows and columns we should zero out by looking at the values in the first row and column, and moving from top-left and working our way down — from top to bottom, from left to right.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(m * n) Space complexity: O(1) where m is the number of rows, and n is the number of columns Thank you for reading! 😊

an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.\nExamples Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5] Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]]

at the example with matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] and try to figure out a way to solve this problem.\nWe are going to start from the top left corner:\nGo right from 1 to 2, Go right again from 2 to 3, now we can’t go right anymore Next, we go down from 3 to 6, Go down one more time from 6 to 9, Now we are going to go left from 9 to 8 because we can’t go down anymore, Go left again from 8 to 7 We can’t go left anymore, so we go up from 7 to 4, and if we try to go up, we see that we already visited it and we can’t go there Lastly, we go right from 4 to 5. If we try to go right, we can see that we cannot go right anymore because we already visited that element To solve this problem we are going to start from the top left corner:\nGo right until we visit all of them Next, we go down and visit all available elements Next, we go left and visit all of the elements Next, we go up We went through all four directions, but we still have some elements left.\nWe took the outermost layer and shrank it. Now we have a sub-matrix, and we can do the same algorithm on it. We can do it by introducing left and right boundaries that we move inward by 1. Similarly, we have top and bottom boundaries that we also need to shrink by 1. After that, we are going to solve the sub-matrix in spiral order by going from top left to the right. You can notice that we’ve gone through all elements, so now we can move our left and right boundaries once more, and stop because we don’t have a rectangle anymore and we visited all elements. Iteration Solution func spiralOrder(_ matrix: [[Int]]) -\u0026gt; [Int] { var res: [Int] = [] var l = 0 var r = matrix[0].count var top = 0 var bottom = matrix.count while l \u0026lt; r \u0026amp;\u0026amp; top \u0026lt; bottom { for i in l ..\u0026lt; r { res.append(matrix[top][i]) } top += 1 for i in top ..\u0026lt; bottom { res.append(matrix[i][r - 1]) } r -= 1 if !(l \u0026lt; r \u0026amp;\u0026amp; top \u0026lt; bottom) { break } for i in stride(from: r - 1, to: l - 1, by: -1) { res.append(matrix[bottom - 1][i]) } bottom -= 1 for i in stride(from: bottom - 1, to: top - 1, by: -1) { res.append(matrix[i][l]) } l += 1 } return res } Explanation We are going to initialize the left boundary at 0, right at len(matrix[0]), top at 0, and bottom at len(matrix) to solve this problem in an easier way and avoid edge cases.\nWe are always going to start at the top left position.\nAfter that, we are going to go right and iterate through the first row, adding values to our result until we reach our right boundary. Now we can go down, so we need to shift our top boundary down by 1, add values to our result, and continue going down until we reach our bottom boundary We can see that we visited all elements in the last column, therefore we can now move our right boundary by decreasing it by 1 Next, we can go through elements to the left until we reach our left boundary and add those elements to our result When we reach the left boundary, you can see that we also finished the entire bottom row, meaning that we can shift our bottom boundary up by 1 Next, we are going to go up until we reach our top boundary, and add values to our result When we reach our top boundary we can update our left boundary by increasing it by 1 Next, we go right and add elements to our result until we reach our right boundary Lastly, when the left boundary reaches the right boundary or top reaches bottom, we will stop our algorithm because we’ve done every single element Time/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(m*n) Space complexity: O(1) extra memory, O(m*n) for the output list Where m is the number of rows, and n is the number of columns Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-spiral-matrix/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven an \u003ccode\u003em x n\u003c/code\u003e \u003ccode\u003ematrix\u003c/code\u003e, return all elements of the \u003ccode\u003ematrix\u003c/code\u003e in spiral order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"examples\"\u003eExamples\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-85d07\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-85d07\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/spiral1.jpg#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]\nOutput: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-f4d28\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-f4d28\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/spiral.jpg#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]]\nOutput: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"constraints\"\u003eConstraints\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003em == matrix.length\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003en == matrix[i].length\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1 \u0026lt;= m, n \u0026lt;= 10\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e-100 \u0026lt;= matrix[i][j] \u0026lt;= 100\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"explanation\"\u003eExplanation\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s look at the example with \u003ccode\u003ematrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]\u003c/code\u003e and try to figure out a way to solve this problem.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-fd35d\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-fd35d\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/54.png#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - Blind 75 - Spiral Matrix"},{"content":"The problem You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).\nYou have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.\nExamples Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]] Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]] Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]] Constraints n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length 1 \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 20 -1000 \u0026lt;= matrix[i][j] \u0026lt;= 1000 Explanation Before we jump to the solution, let\u0026rsquo;s look at how rotation was done to the matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]. The problem occurs when you move value 1 to the position of value 3, because you have to save value 3 temporarily. The same logic applies to values 9 and 7. We also have other values in our outer layer that we need to take care of, values 4, 2, 6, 8. During rotation:\nvalue 2 is going to replace value 6 value 6 is going to replace value 8 value 8 is going to replace value 4 value 4 is going to replace value 2 Lastly, we have the left value 5, that has size 1 by 1, and we can not rotate it.\nSolution func rotate(_ matrix: inout [[Int]]) { let n = matrix.count var l = 0 var r = n - 1 while l \u0026lt; r { for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; r - l { let top = l let bottom = r let topLeft = matrix[top][l + i] matrix[top][l + i] = matrix[bottom - i][l] matrix[bottom - i][l] = matrix[bottom][r - i] matrix[bottom][r - i] = matrix[top + i][r] matrix[top + i][r] = topLeft } r -= 1 l += 1 } } Explanation Let\u0026rsquo;s look at another example. We are going to start rotating from the outermost square layer. After that, we are going to move inward, and we are going to do rotation inside the matrix. The rotation is going to start from top left and we will go clockwise.\nWhen we did the outermost layer, now we need to do the inside layer. We can treat the inside of the matrix as a subproblem, all we need to do is to shift our pointers by 1. As for in-memory replacement, we are going to keep our value in a temporary variable and replace it with the next value. We can slightly improve our solution with temporary variables by doing it in reverse order. Instead of moving values clockwise, we will do it counter-clockwise. The reason we do this is because we only need one temporary variable, which will make the code a little bit easier.\nTime/Space complexity Time complexity: O(n^2) Space complexity: O(1) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-rotate-image/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are given an \u003ccode\u003en x n\u003c/code\u003e 2D \u003ccode\u003ematrix\u003c/code\u003e representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have to rotate the image \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm\"\u003ein-place\u003c/a\u003e, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"examples\"\u003eExamples\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-fafeb\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-fafeb\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/mat1.jpg#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]\nOutput: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-7112f\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-7112f\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/mat2.jpg#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]\nOutput: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"constraints\"\u003eConstraints\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003en == matrix.length == matrix[i].length\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1 \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 20\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e-1000 \u0026lt;= matrix[i][j] \u0026lt;= 1000\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"explanation\"\u003eExplanation\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we jump to the solution, let\u0026rsquo;s look at how rotation was done to the \u003ccode\u003ematrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]\u003c/code\u003e.\n\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-ad954\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-ad954\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/48.png#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - Blind 75 - Rotate Image"},{"content":"The problem Given an array of meeting time intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of conference rooms required.\nExamples Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]] Output: 2 Input: intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]] Output: 1 Constraints 1 \u0026lt;= intervals.length \u0026lt;= 10^4 0 \u0026lt;= starti \u0026lt; endi \u0026lt;= 10^6 Explanation Before jumping to the code, we are going to sort the input because it\u0026rsquo;s not sorted by default.\nSorting Solution func minMeetingRooms(_ intervals: [[Int]]) -\u0026gt; Int { let start = intervals.map({ $0[0] }).sorted() let end = intervals.map({ $0[1] }).sorted() var res = 0 var count = 0 var s = 0 var e = 0 let n = intervals.count while s \u0026lt; n { if start[s] \u0026lt; end[e] { s += 1 count += 1 } else { e += 1 count -= 1 } res = max(res, count) } return res } Explanation We can visualize input with intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]] like this:\nIf we go from left to right, we are going to see the first meeting start at time 0. We keep going and the next meeting started at time 5, and it tells us that we have two meetings that have started but no meeting that has ended. For the counting process, we will be creating and maintaining a count property that will count the number of meetings going on.\nAt time 10, we can see that the second meeting has ended, therefore we are going to decrement our count to 1. Now, we are going to look to the next point in order, where another meeting has started at 15, and we will increment our count property, which will be equal to 2. Next, we are going to repeat the same process and take the next point where the meeting has ended at 20. After that, we are going to take our count and decrement it by 1 — now count == 1. Lastly, we are going to go to our last point, which is also an end time. That means another meeting is stopping, so we decrement our count, therefore count == 0. We noticed that the max count that happened was 2, so we are going to return 2 as our result.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s look at how we are going to sort these intervals and how we are going to iterate over the meetings regardless of whether it\u0026rsquo;s a start time for a meeting or its end time.\nInput intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[10,15]] looks like this:\nLook at the time where point time equals 10: we have two intervals — one that ends at 10 and another that starts at 10. That means these meetings are not overlapping.\nIf we ever have a tie (two points with the exact same value), we always iterate through the end meeting time before we iterate through the start meeting time.\nWe are going to have two input arrays, start and end. After that, we are going to start this problem off using two pointers:\nWe are going to have one pointer at the beginning of the start array, and another at the beginning of the end array. Between the start value and end value, we are going to peek at the minimum. If the minimum of the two is a start point, then we are going to increment our count by 1 and shift the start pointer to the next value. We will continue doing this until we reach a tie. When we reach the tie, the meeting has to end, so we will shift our end pointer to the next one. If we iterate through an end value, that means the meeting has ended, therefore we are going to decrement our count by 1, count == 1. Now, we are going to compare values 10 and 15, where value 10 is smaller, and we are going to increment our count by 1, count == 2. Now we don\u0026rsquo;t have any start times left, so we are going to iterate through end times. From the solution above, we can see that our max count was equal to 2. Therefore, in the result, we will be returning 2.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n*logn) Space complexity: O(n) Thank you for reading! 😊

intervals are not overlapping.\nIntervals [0, 8] and [8, 10] are not considered overlapping, so if one interval starts at 8 and the second interval ends at 8, this means that these intervals are not overlapping, and if we encounter similar cases we would return true.\nSorting Solution func canAttendMeetings(_ intervals: [[Int]]) -\u0026gt; Bool { if intervals.isEmpty { return true } let

ends at 30, The second interval starts at 5 but it ends at 10, and you may notice that this meeting starts before the first meeting ends, meaning that the first interval and second interval are overlapping and we have to return false. You can see that sorting will be helpful to us to solve this problem. We will be sorting all meetings based on the start time of each meeting.\nThe first part of the algorithm will be sorting The second part will be scanning through the entire array of intervals We are going to look at the first two intervals and compare the end time of the first interval and the start time of the second interval.\nIf the start time of the second interval is before the end time of the first interval, that means they are overlapping. If the second interval starts where the first interval ends, that does not mean that intervals are overlapping. We do not need to compare the first interval and the third interval because we sorted the input, and we know that the second interval does not overlap with the first interval. Therefore, there is no way that the third interval could possibly overlap with the first interval.\nNow when we move to the position of the second interval, we are going to be checking if the second and third intervals are overlapping, and we are going to repeat the process described above again by comparing start and end time of intervals.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(n*logn) Space complexity: O(n) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-meeting-rooms/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven an array of meeting time \u003ccode\u003eintervals\u003c/code\u003e where \u003ccode\u003eintervals[i] = [starti, endi]\u003c/code\u003e, determine if a person could attend all meetings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"examples\"\u003eExamples\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]\nOutput: false\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]\nOutput: true\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"constraints\"\u003eConstraints\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e0 \u0026lt;= intervals.length \u0026lt;= 10^4\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eintervals[i].length == 2\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e0 \u0026lt;= starti \u0026lt; endi \u0026lt;= 10^6\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"explanation\"\u003eExplanation\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we dive into coding, let\u0026rsquo;s look at base cases in which intervals are not overlapping.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-32479\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-32479\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/252.png#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - Blind 75 - Meeting Rooms"},{"content":"The problem Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.\nNote that intervals which only touch at a point are non-overlapping.

We are going to merge them by taking the minimum of both start values – 1, and the maximum of both end values – 5. Now the new interval will be [1, 5].\nWe also have one last interval [6, 9] that is not overlapping, so we will add that interval without any changes and the result will be [[1,5],[6,9]].\nOne last thing before we jump into coding: in the description, we don’t have an explanation for the case where we have intervals like [1,2] and [2,3].\nIn this case, the intervals are overlapping because the end of the first interval and the start of the second interval are connected. This counts as overlapping, so we need to merge them.\nLet’s go through some simple cases with input intervals = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]].\nLet’s imagine we were given newInterval = [-1, 0]. Since the end value of this interval is less than the start value of the first interval, this means that this interval is not going to overlap with the first interval. Therefore, this interval is not going to overlap with any of the upcoming intervals either.\nWhat if the opposite were true? Suppose we were given an interval newInterval = [7, 8] where the start value is greater than the end value of the last interval.\nIn this case, the newInterval won’t overlap with any of the other intervals, so we can return the original list and add newInterval to the end of the list.\nThere also exist a few other possibilities:\nWhen newInterval overlaps with one of the other intervals and we need to combine both intervals It is also possible that newInterval overlaps with multiple intervals—in this case, we need to combine multiple intervals Or it could be that newInterval goes somewhere in between two intervals and does not overlap Greedy Solution func insert(_ intervals: [[Int]], _ newInterval: [Int]) -\u0026gt; [[Int]] { let n = intervals.count var newInterval = newInterval var res: [[Int]] = [] for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; n { if newInterval[1] \u0026lt; intervals[i][0] { res.append(newInterval) return res + intervals[i ..\u0026lt; n] } else if newInterval[0] \u0026gt; intervals[i][1] { res.append(intervals[i]) } else { newInterval = [min(newInterval[0], intervals[i][0]), max(newInterval[1], intervals[i][1])] } } res.append(newInterval) return res } Explanation If we want to determine where newInterval goes, we have to iterate through the intervals and find an insertion point.\nWe are going to go interval by interval and check if the current interval overlaps with newInterval. If it doesn’t, we add the current interval to our result.\nTo do that, we need to check: If the end value of newInterval is less than the start value of the current interval If the start value of newInterval is greater than the end value of the current interval If neither of these cases is true, this means that newInterval is overlapping and we need to merge them.\nWe are going to merge them by taking the minimum of the start values and the maximum of the end values.\nTime / Space complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-insert-interval/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are given an array of non-overlapping intervals \u003ccode\u003eintervals\u003c/code\u003e where \u003ccode\u003eintervals[i] = [starti, endi]\u003c/code\u003e represents the start and the end of the \u003ccode\u003eith\u003c/code\u003e interval, and \u003ccode\u003eintervals\u003c/code\u003e is sorted in ascending order by \u003ccode\u003estarti\u003c/code\u003e.

You are initially positioned at the array\u0026rsquo;s first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.\nReturn true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.\nExamples Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4] Output: true Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index. Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4] Output: false Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index. Constraints 1 \u0026lt;= nums.length \u0026lt;= 10⁴ 0 \u0026lt;= nums[i] \u0026lt;= 10⁵ Explanation From the description of the problem, we learn that we start from the start index, and for every element in the array, the number at the position represents the max jump length that we can perform at every single position.\nBasically, this means for input with nums = [2,3,1,1,4]\nFrom the first position, we can jump of length 2 or we can do a jump with length 1. We don’t have to do the max jump length; we can choose to do a 1 jump. Now we are at the position of 3. Now we can do a jump of length 1, or we can do a jump of length 2, or a jump of length 3, and with length 3 we reach the end, therefore we can return true. Recursion Solution func canJump(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Bool { let n = nums.count func dfs(_ i: Int) -\u0026gt; Bool { if i == n - 1 { return true } let end = min(n - 1, i + nums[i]) for j in i + 1 ..\u0026lt; end + 1 { if dfs(j) { return true } } return false } return dfs(0) } Explanation Let’s look at another example with nums=[3,2,1,0,4]\nValues on the edges represent jump length; values below represent indices.\nIf we visualize the example as a decision tree based on indices:\nWe can see that from position 0 we can make three jumps: jump of length 1, 2, and 3. At index 1, we can take 2 jumps: one decision with a jump of length 1, another jump with length 2. At index 2 with value 1, we can take only 1 jump. At index 3, we have a value of 0, which basically means that we can’t take a jump and this path is a dead end for us. This solution is using recursion, and the time complexity will be O(n!), which is very slow. But we don’t actually need to do it because, as you can see, we have a lot of repetitive work and we can optimize it by adding caching to it.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(n!) Space complexity: O(n) Dynamic Programming Top-Down Solution func canJump(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Bool { let n = nums.count var memo: [Int: Bool] = [:] func dfs(_ i: Int) -\u0026gt; Bool { if memo[i] != nil { return memo[i]! } if i == n - 1 { return true } if nums[i] == 0 { return false } let end = min(n - 1, i + nums[i]) for j in i + 1 ..\u0026lt; end + 1 { if dfs(j) { memo[i] = true return true } } memo[i] = false return false } return dfs(0) } Explanation In the previous solution, we learned that we can use caching to optimize our time complexity. We can do it by adding an additional hash map and using it to store the index that we visited and calculate the value for it.\nIn the image with the example of nums=[3,2,1,0,4], we can see that we have paths that we already visited, such as the path with index 2, and that tells us that with caching, we can, for index 2, return false because we cannot reach the end.\nYou may also notice that none of our paths can reach the end. Therefore, when we try to go down to paths like dp[2], dp[3], dp[1], and dp[0], we will return false.\nAs a result, caching helped us speed up the solution to O(n²) time complexity. But we can optimize it even further with a linear time O(n) solution.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(n²) Space complexity: O(n) Greedy Solution func canJump(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Bool { let n = nums.count var goal = n - 1 for i in stride(from: n - 1, to: -1 , by: -1) { if i + nums[i] \u0026gt;= goal { goal = i } } return goal == 0 } Explanation From the previous solution, we learned that we can optimize time complexity from O(n²) to O(n). We can do it by using a Greedy algorithm.\nPreviously, we were trying to solve this problem from start and work to the end. Now let’s do it in reverse order: start at the n position and work our way to the beginning.\nLet’s work our way backwards: our goal is to reach index 4 – the last element in the array.\nIf we look at index 3 before our goal, we can see that it has value 1, and we can reach our goal from this index, meaning we can take our goal post and shift it to index 3. Now we are not trying to reach index 4; our goal post is at index 3. Next, we look at the next position in reverse order with index 2 that has value 1, meaning that we can make a jump of length 1 and reach position with index 3, and we can shift our goal post. We will keep doing it as long as we can reach a goal post. Next, we work our way backwards again. Now we are at the position with index 1 and value 3. We can make a jump of length 3 or less, and we can reach our goal post and shift it. Lastly, we are at the position with index 0 with value of 2, so we can take 2 or 1 jumps and reach our goal post. Therefore, we update our goal post and return true, because from the starting position all the way to the end we were able to reach the last position.

So we can conclude that we can basically ignore the negative prefix value because it is not going to help us find the result, so we are not going to consider it.\nNext, we move to the value of 1 and try to find the max subarray with the value of -3, but we can see that when we sum them we receive a negative -2 value, so this means that we can skip those values and move to the next.\nNow, we move to the value of 4 and sum it with the negative value of -1, that will result in 3. After that, we continue without skipping because our sum resulted in a positive value.\nNext, we use our current sum and add the positive value of 2 to it, so the result will be 5.\nNext, we add 1 to our current sum of 5, that results in 6.\nNext, we add negative -5 to our sum, that results in positive 1.\nLastly, we add 4 to our sum, and now our result equals 5.\nThis algorithm takes linear time, where we go through the array once, removing the negative prefix as we compute the total sum.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(1) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-maximum-subarray/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven an integer array \u003ccode\u003enums\u003c/code\u003e, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"examples\"\u003eExamples\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]  \nOutput: 6  \nExplanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: nums = [1]  \nOutput: 1  \nExplanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]  \nOutput: 23  \nExplanation: The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"constraints\"\u003eConstraints\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1 \u0026lt;= nums.length \u0026lt;= 10⁵\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e-10⁴ \u0026lt;= nums[i] \u0026lt;= 10⁴\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - Blind 75 - Maximum Subarray"},{"content":"The problem Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

Explanation Before we jump to coding, let\u0026rsquo;s look at visual representation with some examples to better understand the problem.\nAn example with input text1 = \u0026quot;abcde\u0026quot;, text2 = \u0026quot;ace\u0026quot;\nWe can see that we have two equal characters a at the beginning of both strings. This means that if both characters match each other, then we can break it into subproblems. This also means that now we are looking into a subproblem of the remainder of both strings plus 1 because we know that the longest subsequence at least is going to be 1 since we found matching pairs of characters.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at an example if the first characters were different: input text1 = “bbcde\u0026quot;, text2 = \u0026quot;ace\u0026quot;\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t add 1 and find the longest subsequence because the first characters are different, but it\u0026rsquo;s possible that the longest subsequence can be between bbcde and ce or it could be between bcde and ace.\nBasically, what we find out based on comparing the first characters — whether they are equal or not — is that we can break the problem into subproblems and solve them.\nRecursion Solution func longestCommonSubsequence(_ text1: String, _ text2: String) -\u0026gt; Int { let text1Array = Array(text1) let text2Array = Array(text2) let text1Count = text1.count let text2Count = text2.count func dfs(_ i: Int, _ j: Int) -\u0026gt; Int { if i == text1Count || j == text2Count { return 0 } if text1Array[i] == text2Array[j] { return 1 + dfs(i + 1, j + 1) } return max(dfs(i + 1, j), dfs(i, j + 1)) } return dfs(0, 0) } Explanation One way to solve this problem is by using the depth-first search algorithm.\nWe will need to take care of a few base cases:\nwhen we reach the end of one of the texts when we find matching characters In the result, we will be returning the max of two values.\nIt is not a very efficient solution because it will take O(2^(m+n)) time complexity, but we can optimize it.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(2^(m+n)) Space complexity: O(m+n) where m is the length of string text1 and n is the length of string text2 Dynamic Programming Top-Down Solution func longestCommonSubsequence(_ text1: String, _ text2: String) -\u0026gt; Int { let text1Array = Array(text1) let text2Array = Array(text2) let text1Count = text1.count let text2Count = text2.count var memo: [IndexHelper: Int] = [:] func dfs(_ i: Int, _ j: Int) -\u0026gt; Int { if i == text1Count || j == text2Count { return 0 } if memo[IndexHelper(i: i, j: j)] != nil { return memo[IndexHelper(i: i, j: j)]! } if text1Array[i] == text2Array[j] { memo[IndexHelper(i: i, j: j)] = 1 + dfs(i + 1, j + 1) } else { memo[IndexHelper(i: i, j: j)] = max(dfs(i + 1, j), dfs(i, j + 1)) } return memo[IndexHelper(i: i, j: j)]! } return dfs(0, 0) } struct IndexHelper: Hashable { let i: Int let j: Int } Explanation We learned from the previous solution that we can optimize time complexity. We can do it by caching.

Since these two characters are not equal, we need to check two different subproblems, and we have two decisions — go right or go down If we go down, we can see that characters c == c and we can go diagonally because we want to look at the last two substrings When we compare d == e we see that they are not equal, then we can’t go diagonally and we need to go to the right and down to find whatever max is and put it in the cell We see that if we go to the right, we are going to be out of bounds, therefore the longest subsequence between a string and out-of-bounds value is going to be 0 The right out-of-bounds column would be filled with 0s. Similarly, the bottom rows also will be filled with 0s When we continue looking from d and e position, we see that we can’t go to the right because we will get 0, and this is not our max value, let’s go down When we go down, we find that e == e and we can look diagonally and put 1 to our row Since we looked through all possible combinations and reached the end of the strings, we can now backtrack along the path that we came from and find the solution.\nWe had 1 at position e and e At position d and e, we went down because d and e characters did not match, so we are going to get value 1 from e and e position and put it into the position of d and e Now we are going back to c and c diagonally, we are doing it because characters c and c match, so we are going to get value of 1 from position d and e, and put it to position c and c and add additional 1 to it, so now the value at position c and c equals 2 From position c and c we are going up and put 2 to b and c row because characters did not match Lastly, we are going back to position a and a diagonally because characters are matching each other, we pass value 2 to it from position b and c, and add additional value of 1, so result at position a and a will be 3, meaning that the longest common subsequence is equal to 3. You can see that we started from the bottom and worked our way up, that’s why this solution is called bottom-up.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(m*n) Space complexity: O(m*n) where m is the length of string text1 and n is the length of string text2 Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-longest-common-subsequence/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven two strings \u003ccode\u003etext1\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003etext2\u003c/code\u003e, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

We do this for every single value, and the time complexity for this solution will be O(2ⁿ).

We also know the values at these indices and can find initial subsequences.\nSo we can go down from value [1] and continue subsequences.\nNow we can say we used index 0, and we can choose from indices 1, 2, and 3. All values at these indices satisfy the increasing order, so we can continue our decision tree. For index 1, we can choose values from indices 2 and 3. If we try to go down from index 2, we see that we can\u0026rsquo;t add a value to our subsequence because it is no longer increasing. We mark this as reaching the limit. We also cannot continue the path from index 3 because no values come after it, so we reach the limit again and cannot increase it anymore. Now let\u0026rsquo;s see how it looks after adding caching:\nIf we try to continue creating a subsequence from index 3, we see that we cannot because it is the last index and no more elements come after it. So LIS[3] = 1, and we do not need to repeat this work. The same applies to index 2, where LIS[2] = 1, because we cannot add a next value (3 \u0026lt; 4). When we move to index 1, we do not need to calculate it again because we already did when calculating index 0. So LIS[1] = 2, and we do not need to go down this path again as it would be repeated work. When our depth-first search reaches the root, we see that the longest subsequence will be LIS[0] = 3.\nThis solution improves the time complexity from O(2ⁿ) to O(n²), but it increases space complexity to O(n²). We can further optimize space complexity.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n²) Space complexity: O(n²) Dynamic programming bottom-up solution func lengthOfLIS(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { let n = nums.count var lis = Array(repeating: 1, count: n) for i in stride(from: n - 1, to: -1, by: -1) { for j in i + 1 ..\u0026lt; n { if nums[i] \u0026lt; nums[j] { lis[i] = max(lis[i], 1 + lis[j]) } } } return lis.max()! } Explanation From the previous solution, we learned that we can optimize space complexity using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach.\nIn this approach, using the example [1, 2, 4, 3], we start at index 3 and work backwards to index 0.\nWe start at index 3 and find the longest increasing subsequence for this index. Since no values come after index 3, this is our base case, so LIS[3] = 1. The longest increasing subsequence for index 2 could be just 1, or it could be 1 + LIS[3]. However, we can only do 1 + LIS[3] if nums[2] \u0026lt; nums[3]. In our case, this is false because 4 \u0026gt; 3, so LIS[2] = 1. When we move to index 1, we have a choice of value 1. We also have a choice of 1 + LIS[2] because nums[1] \u0026lt; nums[2], and 1 + LIS[3] because nums[1] \u0026lt; nums[3]. Now, to find the longest increasing subsequence starting from index 0, we use all calculated values from previous steps and add them together. Since all values greater than the value at index 0 are in increasing order, LIS[0] = 3. This is a much better solution in terms of space complexity.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n²) Space complexity: O(n) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-longest-increasing-subsequence/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven an integer array \u003ccode\u003enums\u003c/code\u003e, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"examples\"\u003eExamples\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]\nOutput: 4\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]\nOutput: 1\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"constraints\"\u003eConstraints\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1 \u0026lt;= nums.length \u0026lt;= 2500\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e-10⁴ \u0026lt;= nums[i] \u0026lt;= 10⁴\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(n log(n)) time complexity?\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - Blind 75 - Longest Increasing Subsequence"},{"content":"The problem Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.\nNote that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.\nExamples Input: s = \u0026#34;leetcode\u0026#34;, wordDict = [\u0026#34;leet\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;code\u0026#34;] Output: true Explanation: Return true because \u0026#34;leetcode\u0026#34; can be segmented as \u0026#34;leet code\u0026#34;.

For example, we can check every character in input s and compare it with characters in wordDict, but this approach is inefficient from a time complexity perspective. Instead:\nwe can take an entire word from wordDict, find its length, get a substring with this length from input s, and compare it. This approach is much more efficient because the max size of wordDict is smaller than the max size of input s.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start by visualizing our problem using a decision tree with input s = “neetcode”, wordDict = [\u0026quot;neet”, “leet”, “code”].\nWe are going to keep track of index i. Our decision tree will have three decisions: \u0026ldquo;neet\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;leet\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;code\u0026rdquo;.\nWe check the first 4 characters in s = “neetcode” and compare them. If they match “neet”, “leet”, or “code”, we proceed; otherwise, we stop that path. \u0026ldquo;neet\u0026rdquo; does match, so we create three more decisions, one for each word in wordDict. When we move to the “neet” word, our i pointer becomes 4. After that, we move our pointer and repeat the previous step. If “code” matches one of our options, we update our i pointer by adding 4, making i = 8. Since this is the end of the string, we return true. This is not a very efficient solution because it takes a lot of time, but we can optimize it using caching.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(t * m^n) Space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of s, m is the number of words in wordDict, and t is the maximum length of any word in wordDict.

To avoid repetitive work at the same index i, we use a hash map to store the result. If we ever reach the same index i again, we return the cached result immediately.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n * m * t) Space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of s, m is the number of words in wordDict, and t is the maximum length of any word in wordDict.

When we reach the last index, we return true.\nNow we apply a bottom-up approach.\nWe iterate through every index in reverse order:\nAt dp[7], dp[6], and dp[5], we get false since there are not enough characters after these indices to form a valid word from wordDict. At dp[4], we set dp[4] = true because it matches \u0026ldquo;code\u0026rdquo;. At dp[3], dp[2], and dp[1], we get false because no words in wordDict start with these characters. Finally, at dp[0], we match \u0026ldquo;neet\u0026rdquo; from wordDict. Since we previously computed dp[4] = true, we set dp[0] = true.

id=\"explanation\"\u003eExplanation\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are multiple ways to solve this problem. For example, we can check every character in input \u003ccode\u003es\u003c/code\u003e and compare it with characters in \u003ccode\u003ewordDict\u003c/code\u003e, but this approach is inefficient from a time complexity perspective. Instead:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - Blind 75 - Word Break"},{"content":"The problem Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product and return the product.\nA subarray is a contiguous, non-empty sequence of elements within an array.\nThe test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.\nExamples Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4] Output: 6 Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6. Input: nums = [-2,0,-1] Output: 0 Explanation: The result cannot be 2 because [-2,-1] is not a subarray. Constraints 1 \u0026lt;= nums.length \u0026lt;= 2 * 10⁴ -10 \u0026lt;= nums[i] \u0026lt;= 10 The product of any subarray of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

This is not very efficient, and the time complexity will be O(n²).\nWe can solve this problem in a more optimal way.\nTime/space complexity Time complexity: O(n²) Space complexity: O(1) Optimized solution func maxProduct(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { var res = nums[0] var currMin = 1 var currMax = 1 for n in nums { let tmpMax = n * currMax currMax = max(n * currMax, n * currMin, n) currMin = min(tmpMax, n * currMin, n) res = max(res, currMax) } return res } Explanation Let’s look at an example where the input is [1, 2, 3].\nIf all numbers are positive, our product will always be increasing. In this case, we can find the result easily by multiplying all of them to get the maximum product.\nNow, let’s consider a scenario where we have all negative numbers: [-1, -2, -3].\nWe can see that:\nMultiplying the first two elements -1 and -2 results in 2. Multiplying all elements results in -6. We also have another subarray that gives a positive number: the last two elements -2 and -3, which result in 6. So, even though we need to find the maximum product subarray, we also need to keep track of the minimum value as well.\nTo find the maximum product subarray for the entire input, it helps to solve the subproblem of the first two elements first and then use that result to compute the overall solution.\nWe also need to track the minimum subarray product, which in the case of the first two elements is -2. So, we keep track of both the positive and negative values.\nWhen we move to -3, we use the previously calculated values to get a new max (6) and a new min (-6).\nEven if we had an additional positive 4 in our input [-1, -2, -3, 4], we would take the maximum value at that point (6) and multiply it by 4.\nWe must also consider edge cases involving 0. If we have an input like [-1, -2, -3, 0, 3, 5], we need to reset our product when encountering 0 because multiplying any number by 0 results in 0. To avoid this issue, we reset the product to 1 when encountering a 0.\nTime/space complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(1) Thank you for reading! 😊

If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.\nYou may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.\nExamples Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11 Output: 3 Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1 Input: coins = [2], amount = 3 Output: -1 Input: coins = [1], amount = 0 Output: 0 Constraints 1 \u0026lt;= coins.length \u0026lt;= 12 1 \u0026lt;= coins[i] \u0026lt;= 2³¹ - 1 0 \u0026lt;= amount \u0026lt;= 10⁴ Dynamic programming top-down solution func coinChange(_ coins: [Int], _ amount: Int) -\u0026gt; Int { var memo: [Int: Int] = [:] let int1e9 = Int(1e9) func dfs(_ amount: Int) -\u0026gt; Int { if amount == 0 { return 0 } if let val = memo[amount] { return val } var res = int1e9 for coin in coins { if amount - coin \u0026gt;= 0 { res = min(res, 1 + dfs(amount - coin)) } } memo[amount] = res return res } let minCoins = dfs(amount) if minCoins \u0026gt;= int1e9 { return -1 } else { return minCoins } } Explanation One of the ways that we can solve this problem is by using a depth-first search algorithm with memoization to optimize the overall time complexity.\nFor example, if we have input [1,3,4,5] and amount = 7, this means that in our decision tree, we have four possible choices.\nWe can choose 1, 3, 4, or 5, and The remainder amount will be 6, 4, 3, and 2 respectively. If we continue going down the path of 5 and choose 2, we still have an unlimited quantity of coins. We can choose 1, 3, 4, or 5.\nIf we choose coin 1, we will have a remainder amount of 1. If we choose coin 3, we get a negative -1, which tells us that 5 + 3 cannot be our amount, and we don\u0026rsquo;t need to continue searching that path. Now, if we choose coin 1, we can also choose 3, 4, 5, but we see that it won’t work because we will end up with negative values.\nIf we choose 1, we finally get to 0, meaning we took 5, then 1, then 1. Counting the coins used, we see that we needed 3 coins. This means we found one possible way to sum up to amount = 7, and we have a working algorithm that provides a solution.\nFrom the above, we learn that we need to take care of two base cases:\nWhen the amount reaches 0, and When the amount is less than 0. We can also see that we can break down the problem into subproblems, and these subproblems repeat themselves.\nFor example, if we have an amount of 1, we don’t need to compute it because we already know that we only need a single coin 1 to reduce it to 0. Since that subproblem repeats, we can store its result instead of recomputing it.\nThis solution is called the dynamic programming top-down approach with memoization.\nTime/space complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Dynamic programming bottom-up solution func coinChange(_ coins: [Int], _ amount: Int) -\u0026gt; Int { var dp = Array(repeating: amount + 1, count: amount + 1) dp[0] = 0 for a in 1 ..\u0026lt; amount + 1 { for c in coins { if a - c \u0026gt;= 0 { dp[a] = min(dp[a], 1 + dp[a - c]) } } } if dp[amount] != amount + 1 { return dp[amount] } else { return -1 } } Explanation We can also solve this problem with a dynamic programming bottom-up algorithm. Instead of solving the original problem with amount = 7, we solve it in reverse order.\nWe start with the smallest amount, 0.\nWe want to know the minimum number of coins required to sum to 0, which we call dp[0]. We know that it takes 0 coins.\nWhen we want to know the minimum number of coins needed to sum up to 1, we can take only 1 coin. Then, we repeat that process.\nFor dp[2], we take 1 + dp[1], resulting in dp[2] = 2. We repeat this process all the way to 7.\nThe computed version of all values will look like this:\nTo compute dp[7], we take 1 + dp[6], which results in 3, but this is not the minimal solution.\nIf we take coin 3, we need 1 + dp[4] = 2, because amount 7 - 3 = 4.\nWe need to compute all our values from input = [1, 3, 4, 5]. We have already computed values 1 and 3, so now we compute the rest. If we take coin 4, the result of 1 + dp[3] will be 2. If we take coin 5, the result of 1 + dp[2] will be 3. Lastly, we find the minimum of the computed values, so the result is 2.\nTime/space complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-coin-change/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are given an integer array \u003ccode\u003ecoins\u003c/code\u003e representing coins of different denominations and an integer \u003ccode\u003eamount\u003c/code\u003e representing a total amount of money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturn the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount.

the ways that we can solve this problem is by using a depth-first search algorithm with memoization to optimize the overall time complexity.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - Blind 75 - Coin Change"},{"content":"The Problem You have intercepted a secret message encoded as a string of numbers. The message is decoded via the following mapping:\n\u0026quot;1\u0026quot; → 'A' \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; → 'B' … \u0026quot;25\u0026quot; → 'Y' \u0026quot;26\u0026quot; → 'Z' However, while decoding the message, you realize that there are many different ways to decode it because some codes are contained within others (e.g., \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;5\u0026quot; vs. \u0026quot;25\u0026quot;).\nFor example, \u0026quot;11106\u0026quot; can be decoded into:\n\u0026quot;AAJF\u0026quot; with the grouping (1, 1, 10, 6) \u0026quot;KJF\u0026quot; with the grouping (11, 10, 6) The grouping (1, 11, 06) is invalid because \u0026quot;06\u0026quot; is not a valid code (only \u0026quot;6\u0026quot; is valid). Note: There may be strings that are impossible to decode.\nGiven a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it. If the entire string cannot be decoded in any valid way, return 0.\nThe test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.\nExamples Input: s = \u0026#34;12\u0026#34; Output: 2 Explanation: \u0026#34;12\u0026#34; could be decoded as \u0026#34;AB\u0026#34; (1 2) or \u0026#34;L\u0026#34; (12). Input: s = \u0026#34;226\u0026#34; Output: 3 Explanation: \u0026#34;226\u0026#34; could be decoded as \u0026#34;BZ\u0026#34; (2 26), \u0026#34;VF\u0026#34; (22 6), or \u0026#34;BBF\u0026#34; (2 2 6). Input: s = \u0026#34;06\u0026#34; Output: 0 Explanation: \u0026#34;06\u0026#34; cannot be mapped to \u0026#34;F\u0026#34; because of the leading zero (\u0026#34;6\u0026#34; is different from \u0026#34;06\u0026#34;). In this case, the string is not a valid encoding, so return 0. Constraints 1 \u0026lt;= s.length \u0026lt;= 100 s contains only digits and may contain leading zeros. Depth-First Search Solution func numDecodings(_ s: String) -\u0026gt; Int { let n = s.count let sArray = Array(s) var dp: [Int: Int] = [n: 1] func dfs(_ i: Int) -\u0026gt; Int { if let cachedResult = dp[i] { return cachedResult } if sArray[i] == \u0026#34;0\u0026#34; { return 0 } var res = dfs(i + 1) if i + 1 \u0026lt; n \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (sArray[i] == \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; || (sArray[i] == \u0026#34;2\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \u0026#34;0123456\u0026#34;.contains(sArray[i + 1]))) { res += dfs(i + 2) } dp[i] = res return res } return dfs(0) } Explanation From the problem description, we learn that each character can be decoded to a specific letter.\nFrom the first example, we see that \u0026quot;12\u0026quot; can be decoded as \u0026quot;AB\u0026quot; because \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; maps to \u0026quot;A\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; maps to \u0026quot;B\u0026quot;, but it can also be decoded as \u0026quot;L\u0026quot;. As a result, we return 2 as the output.\nLooking at the example above, we see that the complexity of this problem comes from double digits. Single digits from 1 to 9 can be easily mapped, but when we have double digits, we must make a decision between two possible interpretations. So, we will use a decision tree to determine all possible decodings from the input.\nThe only issue arises with edge cases. For example, when the input is \u0026quot;06\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;0\u0026quot; does not map to any letter. If a string starts with \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, it is invalid and should return 0 because it cannot be decoded in any way.\nSimilarly, when we have an input like \u0026quot;27\u0026quot;, we cannot include it in the two-character mapping since we only allow numbers \u0026lt;= 26 (as the alphabet has only 26 letters).\nLet’s analyze an example with input \u0026quot;121\u0026quot; and try to solve it using a brute-force approach:\nStarting from the beginning:\nWe can take \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; by itself. We can also take the first two characters \u0026quot;12\u0026quot;. From position \u0026quot;1\u0026quot;, we can take \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;21\u0026quot;. When we reach \u0026quot;21\u0026quot;, we can’t make further decisions since we\u0026rsquo;ve reached the end of the string. From \u0026quot;2\u0026quot;, we can take \u0026quot;1\u0026quot;, and we reach the end. If we start from \u0026quot;12\u0026quot;, we are left with one character \u0026quot;1\u0026quot;. Thus, there are three different ways to solve this case.\nWe will use Depth-First Search (DFS) and store results in a hash map to reduce the overall time complexity.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Dynamic Programming Solution func numDecodings(_ s: String) -\u0026gt; Int { let n = s.count let sArray = Array(s) var dp: [Int: Int] = [n: 1] for i in stride(from: n - 1, through: 0, by: -1) { if sArray[i] == \u0026#34;0\u0026#34; { dp[i] = 0 } else { dp[i] = dp[i + 1] } if i + 1 \u0026lt; n \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (sArray[i] == \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; || (sArray[i] == \u0026#34;2\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \u0026#34;0123456\u0026#34;.contains(sArray[i + 1]))) { dp[i]! += dp[i + 2]! } } return dp[0]! } Explanation In the previous solution, we used recursion and additional memory to solve the problem, but we can actually optimize it using a true dynamic programming approach.\nWe split the problem into smaller subproblems and find a solution iteratively.\nFor example, with input \u0026quot;121\u0026quot;:\nWe take the first \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; and ask how many ways we can decode the remaining \u0026quot;21\u0026quot;. If we take \u0026quot;12\u0026quot;, we then ask how many ways we can decode \u0026quot;1\u0026quot;. Each subproblem corresponds to some portion of the string.\nThis solution takes O(n) space, but we can optimize further and solve it in O(1) space by removing the hash map and using two variables instead.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Dynamic Programming (Space-Optimized) Solution func numDecodings(_ s: String) -\u0026gt; Int { let n = s.count let sArray = Array(s) var dp = 0 var dp2 = 0 var dp1 = 1 for i in stride(from: n - 1, to: -1 , by: -1) { if sArray[i] == \u0026#34;0\u0026#34; { dp = 0 } else { dp = dp1 } if (i + 1 \u0026lt; n \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (sArray[i] == \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; || sArray[i] == \u0026#34;2\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \u0026#34;0123456\u0026#34;.contains(sArray[i + 1]) ) ) { dp += dp2 } let tmpDp = dp let tmpDp1 = dp1 dp = 0 dp1 = tmpDp dp2 = tmpDp1 } return dp1 } Explanation When decoding an entire string, we:\nConsider \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; alone and shift the pointer to \u0026quot;21\u0026quot; to solve that subproblem. Consider \u0026quot;12\u0026quot; together and solve the subproblem \u0026quot;1\u0026quot;. To compute dp[i], we only need dp[i + 1] and dp[i + 2], so instead of storing all values, we use just two variables.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(1) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-decode-ways/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe Problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have intercepted a secret message encoded as a string of numbers.

Brute Force Solution func countSubstrings(_ s: String) -\u0026gt; Int { let n = s.count let sArray = Array(s) var res = 0 for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; n { for j in i ..\u0026lt; n { var l = i var r = j while l \u0026lt; r \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sArray[l] == sArray[r] { l += 1 r -= 1 } res += (l \u0026gt;= r) ? 1 : 0 } } return res } Explanation We can solve this problem by understanding how a brute-force approach works and then optimizing it.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say we are given a string s = \u0026quot;aaab\u0026quot;. If we start brute-forcing it, we need to go through every single substring starting from the first position, and it will look like this:\nIn total, there will be n^2 substrings, and for each substring, we need to determine if it is a palindrome. This check takes O(n), because we use two pointers to compare characters.\nThus, the overall time complexity will be O(n³).\nWe can improve time complexity by using a dynamic programming algorithm.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n³) Space complexity: O(1) Dynamic Programming Solution func countSubstrings(_ s: String) -\u0026gt; Int { let n = s.count let sArray = Array(s) var res = 0 var dp = Array(repeating: Array(repeating: false, count: n), count: n) for i in stride(from: n - 1, to: -1, by: -1) { for j in i ..\u0026lt; n { if sArray[i] == sArray[j] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (j - i \u0026lt;= 2 || dp[i + 1][j - 1]) { dp[i][j] = true res += 1 } } } return res } Explanation We can optimize the brute-force solution using a dynamic programming approach, but this requires additional memory.\nWe use a dp 2D array to keep track of palindromic substrings. res is a variable to keep count of the number of palindromic substrings. We iterate through the string in reverse order and use an inner loop to iterate from i to the end.\nNext, we check if the characters are equal and either:\nThe substring is of length ≤ 2, or The inner substring is already a palindrome (checked using dp[i + 1][j - 1]). When we find a palindrome, we update res. Finally, we return res.\nWe can further reduce space complexity by solving this problem using the two-pointers technique.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n²) Space complexity: O(n²) Two Pointers Solution func countSubstrings(_ s: String) -\u0026gt; Int { let n = s.count let sArray = Array(s) var res = 0 for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; n { // odd-length palindromes var l = i var r = i while l \u0026gt;= 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; r \u0026lt; n \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sArray[l] == sArray[r] { res += 1 l -= 1 r += 1 } // even-length palindromes l = i r = i + 1 while l \u0026gt;= 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; r \u0026lt; n \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sArray[l] == sArray[r] { res += 1 l -= 1 r += 1 } } return res } Explanation We can optimize the brute-force solution by solving it in a different way.\nInstead of checking every substring, we expand outward from each character, treating it as the center of a palindrome.\nWe initialize two pointers (l and r) at the same position and expand outward. If characters match, we count that substring as a palindrome. We repeat this for both odd-length (single center) and even-length (two centers) palindromes. At every step, we expand l to the left and r to the right, counting palindromic substrings until we go out of bounds.\nBy using this two-pointers approach, we avoid repeated work, reducing overall time complexity and space complexity.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n²) Space complexity: O(1) Thank you for reading! 😊

Blind 75 - Palindromic Substrings"},{"content":"The Problem Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.\nA string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.\nExamples Input: s = \u0026#34;babad\u0026#34; Output: \u0026#34;bab\u0026#34; Explanation: \u0026#34;aba\u0026#34; is also a valid answer. Input: s = \u0026#34;cbbd\u0026#34; Output: \u0026#34;bb\u0026#34; Constraints 1 \u0026lt;= s.length \u0026lt;= 1000 s consists of only digits and English letters. Brute Force Solution func longestPalindrome(_ s: String) -\u0026gt; String { let sArray = Array(s) var res = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; var resLen = 0 let n = s.count for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; n { for j in i ..\u0026lt; n { var l = i var r = j while l \u0026lt; r \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sArray[l] == sArray[r] { l += 1 r -= 1 } if l \u0026gt;= r \u0026amp;\u0026amp; resLen \u0026lt; (j - i + 1) { res = String(sArray[i ..\u0026lt; j + 1]) resLen = j - i + 1 } } } return res } Explanation In the first example, we are given the input \u0026quot;babad\u0026quot;. Let’s visualize it and try to find the longest palindromic substring.\nAs you can see, we have two different palindromic substrings: \u0026quot;bab\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;aba\u0026quot;, so we could return either of these.\nThe brute force solution to this problem involves checking every single substring, verifying if it\u0026rsquo;s a palindrome, and finding the longest one.\nThis solution is not very efficient because we need to scan through the entire string and check every substring. As a result, the time complexity is O(n * n^2) -\u0026gt; O(n^3).\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n³) Space complexity: O(1) Dynamic Programming Solution func longestPalindrome(_ s: String) -\u0026gt; String { var resIdx = 0 var resLen = 0 let n = s.count let sArray = Array(s) var dp: [[Bool]] = Array(repeating: Array(repeating: false, count: n), count: n) for i in stride(from: n - 1, to: -1, by: -1) { for j in i ..\u0026lt; n { if sArray[i] == sArray[j] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (j - i \u0026lt;= 2 || dp[i + 1][j - 1]) { dp[i][j] = true if resLen \u0026lt; (j - i + 1) { resIdx = i resLen = j - i + 1 } } } } return String(sArray[resIdx ..\u0026lt; resIdx + resLen]) } Explanation Another way to solve this problem is by using a dynamic programming algorithm.\nWe create resIdx to store the starting index of the result. resLen stores the length of the result. dp is a 2D array to keep track of palindromic substrings. After that, we iterate through the string in reverse and use an inner loop to iterate from i to the end.\nNext, we check if the characters are equal and either:\nThe substring is shorter than or equal to length 3, or The inner substring is already a palindrome. When we find a palindrome, we check if it\u0026rsquo;s longer than the current result. If so, we update our pointers.\nFinally, we return the result substring using the calculated pointers.\nThis is not a very efficient solution in terms of space complexity. We can improve it using the two-pointer technique.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n²) Space complexity: O(n²) Two-Pointer Solution func longestPalindrome(_ s: String) -\u0026gt; String { var resIdx = 0 var resLen = 0 let n = s.count let sArray = Array(s) for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; n { // Odd length var l = i var r = i while l \u0026gt;= 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; r \u0026lt; n \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sArray[l] == sArray[r] { if (r - l + 1) \u0026gt; resLen { resIdx = l resLen = r - l + 1 } l -= 1 r += 1 } // Even length l = i r = i + 1 while l \u0026gt;= 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; r \u0026lt; n \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sArray[l] == sArray[r] { if (r - l + 1) \u0026gt; resLen { resIdx = l resLen = r - l + 1 } l -= 1 r += 1 } } return String(sArray[resIdx ..\u0026lt; resIdx + resLen]) } Explanation Finally, we can solve this problem in a space-optimized way using the two-pointer technique.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s visualize how we can check if a substring is a palindrome using the example \u0026quot;bab\u0026quot;:\nWe can check if it\u0026rsquo;s a palindrome by starting from the outside and comparing the characters. As long as they are equal, we continue until we reach the middle, confirming it is a palindrome. Another way:\nWe can start in the middle, expand outward, and check if it’s a palindrome that way. You can see that the second method is more efficient, so we will use this approach.\nFor each character, we consider it as the center and expand outward. Since we take each character (n) and expand outward (n), the overall time complexity is O(n²).\nFinally, we need to handle one edge case: checking for palindromes of even length.\nTime/Space

Let’s visualize it and try to find the longest palindromic substring.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - Blind 75 - Longest Palindromic Substring"},{"content":"The problem You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses in this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses are broken into on the same night.\nGiven an integer array nums representing the amount of money in each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.\nExamples Input: nums = [2,3,2] Output: 3 Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2) because they are adjacent houses. Input: nums = [1,2,3,1] Output: 4 Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3). Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4. Input: nums = [1,2,3] Output: 3 Constraints 1 \u0026lt;= nums.length \u0026lt;= 100 0 \u0026lt;= nums[i] \u0026lt;= 1000 Depth-first search (memoization) solution func rob(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { let n = nums.count if n == 1 { return nums[0] } var memo: [Index: Int] = [:] func dfs(_ i: Int, _ flag: Bool) -\u0026gt; Int { if i \u0026gt;= n || (flag \u0026amp;\u0026amp; i == n - 1) { return 0 } if memo[Index(i, flag)] != nil { return memo[Index(i, flag)]! } memo[Index(i, flag)] = max(dfs(i + 1, flag), nums[i] + dfs(i + 2, flag || i == 0)) return memo[Index(i, flag)]! } return max(dfs(0, true), dfs(1, false)) } struct Index: Hashable { let i: Int let flag: Bool init(_ i: Int, _ flag: Bool) { self.i = i self.flag = flag } } Explanation This problem is very similar to the first House Robber problem. The main difference is that the last house is connected to the first.\nWe can reuse the solution from the first House Robber problem.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a closer look at both of these problems.\nIn the first House Robber problem:\nWe can find the max amount we can rob until the second house; the total will be 2. Next, we can find the max amount we can rob until the third house; the total will be 3. Lastly, when looking at the entire array, we can rob house three, skip house two, and rob house one, giving a total of 4. When looking at the second House Robber problem, we see that we need to make some adjustments to reuse the solution from the first problem because the first and last houses are connected.\nWe can reuse the solution from the first problem by robbing the entire array except for the last value. We can also run the reused solution on the entire array except for the first value.\nOne way to solve this problem is by using the DFS algorithm with memoization. We can reuse the algorithm from the first problem by adjusting it slightly. We will add an additional flag and a base case to detect a cycle between the last and first houses.\nThis solution does not follow the dynamic programming category; it\u0026rsquo;s a more brute-force way of solving this type of problem. We can rewrite it using true dynamic programming.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Dynamic programming solution func rob(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { let n = nums.count if n == 1 { return nums[0] } return max(helper(Array(nums[1...])), helper(Array(nums[0..\u0026lt;n - 1]))) } func helper(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { let n = nums.count if n == 0 { return 0 } if n == 1 { return nums[0] } var dp = Array(repeating: 0, count: n) dp[0] = nums[0] dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1]) for i in 2 ..\u0026lt; n { dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], nums[i] + dp[i - 2]) } return dp.last! } Explanation Another way to solve this problem is by using the dynamic programming algorithm.\nWe will need a helper function that we can reuse from the first House Robber problem. We will call it on two subarrays:\nThe first subarray excludes the first house. The second subarray excludes the last house. In the end, we will find the max result.\nThis solution takes O(n) space, but we can optimize memory by replacing the dp array with two properties.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Dynamic programming (space optimized) solution func rob(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { let n = nums.count return max(nums[0], helper(Array(nums[1...])), helper(Array(nums[0..\u0026lt;n - 1]))) } func helper(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { var rob1 = 0 var rob2 = 0 for n in nums { let newRob = max(rob1 + n, rob2) rob1 = rob2 rob2 = newRob } return rob2 } Explanation Lastly, we can solve this problem using a space-optimized dynamic programming algorithm.\nBasically, we maintain two properties that store the max amount that can be robbed from the previous two houses.\nWe iterate over every house in the input array and compute the max that can be robbed up to that point by choosing between robbing house one and skipping house two, or skipping rob1 and including rob2. We then update our properties. As a result, rob2 will contain the maximum amount that can be robbed. We also need to handle a few edge cases:\nWe need to skip the first house. We also need to skip the last house. The last edge case occurs when the input array contains only one element, so we need to include the first element to avoid a result of 0.

Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. The only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected, and they will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses are broken into on the same night.\nGiven an integer array nums representing the amount of money in each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.\nExamples Input: nums = [1,2,3,1] Output: 4 Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3). Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4. Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1] Output: 12 Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9), and rob house 5 (money = 1). Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

We also learn that we can\u0026rsquo;t rob every house because there is a restriction: we can only rob houses that are not adjacent to each other.\nThis problem belongs to the dynamic programming category. Let\u0026rsquo;s draw a decision tree using the example nums = [1,2,3,1].\nWe start at 1. We can\u0026rsquo;t rob 2 because it\u0026rsquo;s adjacent to 1, so we need to decide whether to rob 3 or 1. We choose to rob houses 1 and 3, giving us a total of 4.\nIf we decide to rob house 2, we can only rob house 4, resulting in a total of 3, which is not the optimal solution since we already found a greater total of 4.\nThis is a brute-force approach. Imagine if we had more numbers—our decision tree would grow exponentially, making it very complex. We can improve this by identifying subproblems.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s analyze the subproblem:\nWe have two choices to maximize our total robbery amount:\nRob the first house, then find the maximum from the remaining houses. Skip the first house and find the maximum in the subarray excluding the first value. In our first decision, we rob the first value, so we skip index 1 and rob the remaining array from index 2 to n. In code, this looks like rob = arr[0] + rob[2:n].\nIf we do not rob the first house, we solve the subproblem by starting from house 1 and continuing until the end of the array.\nEach robbery decision can be broken into subproblems:\nIf we rob the first house, we get a total of 1. Next, we decide whether to rob house 2, which has a larger total of 2. Then, we decide whether to rob house 3 (which includes robbing house 1) or just rob house 2. The maximum choice is robbing house 3 and house 1, giving a total of 4. Lastly, we decide between robbing house 4 and house 1, or robbing house 4 and house 2. The best choice is robbing house 4 and house 2, totaling 3. Time and Space Complexity Time Complexity: O(n) Space Complexity: O(n) Dynamic Programming Solution func rob(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { let n = nums.count if n == 1 { return nums[0] } var dp = Array(repeating: 0, count: n) dp[0] = nums[0] dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1]) for i in 2 ..\u0026lt; n { dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], nums[i] + dp[i - 2]) } return dp.last! } Explanation We can also solve this problem using a dynamic programming approach. The main idea remains the same as explained above, but instead of recursion, we use an array and iteration.\nThis approach takes O(n) space, but we can optimize it further to O(1) space by using two variables instead of an additional array.\nTime and Space Complexity Time Complexity: O(n) Space Complexity: O(n) Dynamic Programming (Space Optimized) Solution func rob(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { var rob1 = 0 var rob2 = 0 for n in nums { let temp = max(n + rob1, rob2) rob1 = rob2 rob2 = temp } return rob2 } Explanation We don\u0026rsquo;t need an additional array to store values because we only need to track the last two computed results.\nThis works because we either decide to rob the fourth house and the first and second house (excluding 3), totaling 2,\nor we skip robbing the fourth house and rob the first, second, and third houses, totaling 4.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve learned that we only need to maintain the last two max values we can rob. Instead of using an array, we use two variables and iterate through nums, computing the maximum at each step:\nn + rob1 represents robbing the current house (with a gap from the previous one). rob2 represents skipping the current house and keeping the previous max. We update the variables accordingly.

A better way to do it is by visualizing it as a decision tree.\nFor example, Input: n = 5\nOne way to solve this problem is by using a depth-first search algorithm and recursively finding all possible solutions. However, it could be problematic because it uses O(2^n) time complexity, which could be very slow and even exceed all available memory due to recursion stack calls.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(2^n) Space complexity: O(n) Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up) Solution func climbStairs(_ n: Int) -\u0026gt; Int { if n \u0026lt;= 2 { return n } var dp = Array(repeating: 0, count: n + 1) dp[1] = 1 dp[2] = 2 for i in 3 ..\u0026lt; n + 1 { dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2] } return dp[n] } Explanation Another way we can solve this problem is by using true dynamic programming.\nAs you can see, starting from 0, the result depends on subproblem 1, subproblem 1 depends on subproblem 2, and so on, until it finally depends on our base case 5. Why don’t we start from the bottom, solve our base case, and work our way up to the original problem at 0? (This is called the bottom-up dynamic programming approach.)\nWe will be storing our result in an array called dp. We are going to have positions in dp from position 0 all the way up to n.\nInitially, at the base case of 5, we can take only one step. Now, when we solve 5, we can solve 4 because subproblem 4 depends on subproblem 5. From 4, we can take one step, which leads to our result, or we can take two steps, which leads us out of bounds. As a result, we have only one way to solve subproblem 4. Then we want to know how many ways from 3 we can reach 5. The subproblem 3 depends on two subproblems that come after it: 4 and 5. So, we can take one step or two steps. As a result, to solve subproblem 3, we take the next two values from dp and add them together. We continue the same process for positions 2, 1, and 0. The complexity of the dynamic programming solution is much better than the recursive solution, taking O(n) time and O(n) space. However, we can optimize it even further to O(n) time and O(1) space.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Dynamic Programming (Space Optimized) Solution func climbStairs(_ n: Int) -\u0026gt; Int { var one = 1 var two = 1 for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; n - 1 { let tmp = one one = one + two two = tmp } return one } Explanation From the picture above, you can notice that each value in the dp array depends on the two values that come after it. For example, 8 depends on 5 and 3, etc.\nAs a result, we don’t need to store the entire array. Instead, we can use two different variables.\nLet’s initialize one and two properties to represent steps and help us compute the next value. Once we compute the next value, we shift one and two variables and keep doing it until we get to the result at 0.\nIf we initialize one and two properties with the value 1, we need to compute n-1 values and return the result stored in one.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(1) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-climbing-stairs/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are climbing a staircase.

Depth-First Search Solution func alienOrder(_ words: [String]) -\u0026gt; String { var adj: [Character: Set\u0026lt;Character\u0026gt;] = [:] for w in words { for c in w { adj[c] = [] } } for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; words.count - 1 { let w1 = Array(words[i]) let w2 = Array(words[i + 1]) let minLen = min(w1.count, w2.count) if w1.count \u0026gt; w2.count \u0026amp;\u0026amp; String(w1.prefix(minLen)) == String(w2.prefix(minLen)) { return \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } for j in 0 ..\u0026lt; minLen { if w1[j] != w2[j] { adj[w1[j], default: []].insert(w2[j]) break } } } var visit: [Character: Bool] = [:] var res: [Character] = [] func dfs(_ c: Character) -\u0026gt; Bool { if visit[c] != nil { return visit[c]! } visit[c] = true for nei in adj[c]! { if dfs(nei) { return true } } visit[c] = false res.append(c) return false } for c in adj.keys { if dfs(c) { return \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } } return String(res.reversed()) } Explanation From the description, we learn that we need to figure out the ordering of the alien alphabet. We know that the English language has the ordering abc…z with 26 characters, but in this problem, they state that we have a different ordering of these characters, and our goal is to find out this ordering.\nTo determine the ordering, we will compare each character in adjacent words. If a character in the second word comes before the corresponding character in the first word, we will update the ordering. For example, given the words [\u0026quot;apple\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ape\u0026quot;], we realize that \u0026quot;ape\u0026quot; should come before \u0026quot;apple\u0026quot;.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s visualize the first example given in the problem:\nInput: words = [\u0026quot;wrt\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;wrf\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;er\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;ett\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;rftt\u0026quot;]\nWe can see that we can use these characters and their relative order to build a graph. Now, we can traverse the graph.\nWe also need to take care of corner cases such as cycles in the graph or the presence of multiple separate graphs.\nIf we detect a cycle in the graph, we return \u0026quot;\u0026quot;. If we have multiple separate graphs, we use postorder DFS to avoid incorrect ordering and merge separate graphs into a single ordering. To do this, we use a visit dictionary to track visited nodes and detect cycles.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(N + V + E) Space complexity: O(V + E) Where V is the number of unique characters, E is the number of edges, and N is the sum of the lengths of all strings. Topological Sort (Kahn’s Algorithm) Solution func alienOrder(_ words: [String]) -\u0026gt; String { var adj: [Character: Set\u0026lt;Character\u0026gt;] = [:] var indegree: [Character: Int] = [:] for w in words { for c in w { adj[c] = [] indegree[c] = 0 } } for i in 0..\u0026lt;words.count - 1 { let w1 = Array(words[i]) let w2 = Array(words[i + 1]) let minLen = min(w1.count, w2.count) if w1.count \u0026gt; w2.count \u0026amp;\u0026amp; w1.prefix(minLen) == w2.prefix(minLen) { return \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } for j in 0..\u0026lt;minLen { if w1[j] != w2[j] { if !adj[w1[j]]!.contains(w2[j]) { adj[w1[j]]!.insert(w2[j]) indegree[w2[j], default: 0] += 1 } break } } } var q: [Character] = [] for (char, degree) in indegree { if degree == 0 { q.append(char) } } var res: [Character] = [] while !q.isEmpty { let char = q.removeFirst() res.append(char) if let neighbors = adj[char] { for neighbor in neighbors { indegree[neighbor, default: 0] -= 1 if indegree[neighbor] == 0 { q.append(neighbor) } } } } return res.count == indegree.count ? String(res) : \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } Explanation We can also solve this problem using Topological Sort (Kahn’s Algorithm). The difference between topological sort and depth-first search is that topological sort takes a directed graph and returns an array of nodes where each node appears before all the nodes it points to.\nThe ordering of the nodes in the array is called topological ordering.\nFor example:\nSince node 1 points to nodes 2 and 3, node 1 appears before them in the ordering. And since nodes 2 and 3 both point to node 4, they appear before it in the ordering.\nSo [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] would be a topological ordering of the graph.\nCan a graph have more than one topological ordering? Yes! In the example above, [1, 3, 2, 4, 5] is also a valid ordering.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(N + V + E) Space complexity: O(V + E) Where V is the number of unique characters, E is the number of edges, and N is the sum of the lengths of all strings.

Let\u0026rsquo;s clarify what a connected component means:\nIf we are given two nodes, for example, 3 and 4, without edges, then we just return the number of nodes given. In this case, we have two nodes, so we return 2 because: One node by itself counts as a connected component. To solve this problem, we are going to:\nCreate an adjacency list. Traverse every single node using the DFS algorithm. Mark nodes as visited. Count the number of connected components by the number of DFS calls. Time/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(V + E) Space complexity: O(V + E) Where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

This algorithm was literally designed for problems like this—it helps find connected components and identify disjoint sets.\nWe maintain two arrays:\nparent, where each node initially points to itself. For example, [0,1,2,3,4] means each node is its own parent. rank, which helps track the size of each connected component. Union-Find works like a forest of trees. Initially, we have n trees (one for each node). As we traverse through each edge, we:\nConnect the nodes (merge them). Decrease the number of connected components by 1. We add one small optimization by maintaining the rank, which helps keep track of the size of connected components. As we continue connecting nodes, we always attach a smaller tree to the root of a larger tree to minimize tree height.\nFor example, if we connect [1,2], we make 0 the root and add 2 as a child of 0. This means the rank of 0 increases to 3, and the parent array changes from [0,1,2,3,4] to [0,0,0,3,4].\nOnce we process edges [3,4], the rank of 3 increases to 2, and the parent array updates to [0,0,0,3,3]. Each time we perform a union operation, we decrement the number of connected components by 1.\nIf we encounter an edge like [0,2], we immediately return before making changes because they already share the same parent.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(V + (E * α(V))) Space complexity: O(V) Where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and α(V) is the inverse Ackermann function (which is nearly constant in practical use).

You are given an integer n and a list of edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.\nReturn true if the edges of the given graph make up a valid tree, and false otherwise.\nExamples Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,4]] Output: true Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[1,3],[1,4]] Output: false Constraints 1 \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 2000 0 \u0026lt;= edges.length \u0026lt;= 5000 edges[i].length == 2 0 \u0026lt;= ai, bi \u0026lt; n ai != bi There are no self-loops or repeated edges.

However, the description does not define what a valid tree is. Let\u0026rsquo;s start there.\nA valid tree cannot have loops (cycles), for example:\nA tree needs to be connected; if it is not, it is an invalid tree, for example:\nAn empty graph counts as a valid tree. We take the input nodes and edges and check if they are connected and if they do not form a loop (cycle). To do that, we need to create an adjacency list for every single input node.\nWe use the DFS algorithm and visit the neighbors of every single node recursively. If no cycle is detected and the length of the visit set equals n, this means the graph is a valid tree, and we return true; otherwise, we return false. To avoid false positive results when backtracking, we add a prev property that tracks the previous value, compares it to the current index, and skips it if they are equal.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(V + E) Space complexity: O(V + E) Where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. Breadth First Search Solution func validTree(_ n: Int, _ edges: [[Int]]) -\u0026gt; Bool { if n == 0 { return true } var adj: [Int: [Int]] = [:] for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; n { adj[i] = [] } for value in edges { let u = value[0] let v = value[1] adj[u]!.append(v) adj[v]!.append(u) } var visit: Set\u0026lt;Int\u0026gt; = [] var q: [(Int, Int)] = [(0, -1)] visit.insert(0) while !q.isEmpty { let value = q.removeFirst() let node = value.0 let parent = value.1 for nei in adj[node]! { if nei == parent { continue } if visit.contains(nei) { return false } visit.insert(nei) q.append((nei, node)) } } return visit.count == n } Explanation We can also solve this problem using the Breadth First Search algorithm. Instead of recursion, we use iteration. The logic behind the solution remains the same: we create an adjacency list, iterate over every single node and its neighbors, and update our visit set.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(V + E) Space complexity: O(V + E) Where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

In our case, this applies to 4 and 2.\nRecursively, we will end up going back from 4 to 3, and since we were able to complete prerequisite 4, this means that we can complete prerequisite 3.\nIf this is the case, we can now remove prerequisite 3 and continue DFS by going back to 1, etc.\nTime/space complexity Time complexity: O(V + E) Space complexity: O(V + E) Where V is the number of courses and E is the number of prerequisites Topological Sort (Kahn\u0026rsquo;s Algorithm) solution func canFinish(_ numCourses: Int, _ prerequisites: [[Int]]) -\u0026gt; Bool { var indegree = Array(repeating: 0, count: numCourses) var adj: [Int: [Int]] = [:] for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; numCourses { adj[i] = [] } for value in prerequisites { let src = value[0] let dst = value[1] indegree[dst] += 1 adj[src]!.append(dst) } var q: [Int] = [] for n in 0 ..\u0026lt; numCourses { if indegree[n] == 0 { q.append(n) } } var finish = 0 while !q.isEmpty { let node = q.removeFirst() finish += 1 for nei in adj[node]! { indegree[nei] -= 1 if indegree[nei] == 0 { q.append(nei) } } } return finish == numCourses } Explanation We can solve this problem in another way by using Topological Sort (Kahn\u0026rsquo;s Algorithm).\nKahn’s algorithm helps us solve course scheduling puzzles.\nFrom the problem description, we find that we need to figure out the order in which we can take courses, considering which ones depend on others.\nKahn’s algorithm checks if we can create a workable schedule without any cycles (like taking a course that requires another that you haven’t taken yet). It also arranges courses in the right order.\nTime/space complexity Time complexity: O(V + E) Space complexity: O(V + E) Where V is the number of courses and E is the number of prerequisites Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-course-schedule/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a total of \u003ccode\u003enumCourses\u003c/code\u003e courses you have to take, labeled from \u003ccode\u003e0\u003c/code\u003e to \u003ccode\u003enumCourses - 1\u003c/code\u003e.

The Pacific Ocean touches the island\u0026rsquo;s left and top edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the island\u0026rsquo;s right and bottom edges.\nThe island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an m x n integer matrix heights where heights[r][c] represents the height above sea level of the cell at coordinate (r, c).\nThe island receives a lot of rain, and the rainwater can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell\u0026rsquo;s height is less than or equal to the current cell\u0026rsquo;s height.

This can happen only if an adjacent cell has a lower or equal value than the current cell. The water can flow in four directions (above, left, right, and below).\nFor example, with input:\nheights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]\n5 \u0026gt; 3, 5 \u0026gt; 1, and 5 \u0026gt; 4 The 3 to the right of 5 has a neighbor of 1 and follows the condition 3 \u0026gt; 1, meaning we can reach the Atlantic Ocean. The 4 to the left of 5 has a neighbor of 2, and also follows the condition 4 \u0026gt; 2, meaning we can reach the Pacific Ocean. As a result, we include the position of 5 in our result. One way to solve this problem is to find every cell that borders the Pacific Ocean (everything in the first row and first column). Similarly, we do the same for the Atlantic Ocean (everything in the last row and last column). We use graph traversal with DFS to find which positions can reach both oceans.\nThe first thing we do is iterate through the first row (Pacific) and run DFS to find all nodes that can reach the Pacific Ocean. We do the same for the bottom row (Atlantic). We maintain these values in a set to avoid duplicates.\nTime/Space Complexity Time Complexity: O(m * n) Space Complexity: O(m * n) Where m is the number of rows, and n is the number of columns. Breadth-First Search (BFS) Solution func pacificAtlantic(_ heights: [[Int]]) -\u0026gt; [[Int]] { let ROWS = heights.count let COLS = heights[0].count let directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)] var pac = Array(repeating: Array(repeating: false, count: COLS), count: ROWS) var atl = Array(repeating: Array(repeating: false, count: COLS), count: ROWS) func bfs(_ sources: [(Int, Int)], _ ocean: inout [[Bool]]) { var q = sources while !q.isEmpty { let (r, c) = q.removeFirst() ocean[r][c] = true for (dr, dc) in directions { let nr = r + dr let nc = c + dc if nr \u0026gt;= 0, nr \u0026lt; ROWS, nc \u0026gt;= 0, nc \u0026lt; COLS, !ocean[nr][nc], heights[nr][nc] \u0026gt;= heights[r][c] { q.append((nr, nc)) } } } } } Explanation We can also solve this problem using BFS instead of DFS. The logic stays the same, but we use an iterative approach instead of recursion.\nTime/Space Complexity remains O(m * n).\nThank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-pacific-atlantic-water-flow/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is an \u003ccode\u003em x n\u003c/code\u003e rectangular island that borders both the \u003cstrong\u003ePacific Ocean\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eAtlantic Ocean\u003c/strong\u003e.

For example, the first node has val == 1, the second node has val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.\nAn adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.\nThe given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.\nExamples Example 1 Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]] Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]] Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph. 1st node (val = 1)\u0026#39;s neighbors are the 2nd node (val = 2) and the 4th node (val = 4). 2nd node (val = 2)\u0026#39;s neighbors are the 1st node (val = 1) and the 3rd node (val = 3). 3rd node (val = 3)\u0026#39;s neighbors are the 2nd node (val = 2) and the 4th node (val = 4). 4th node (val = 4)\u0026#39;s neighbors are the 1st node (val = 1) and the 3rd node (val = 3).

The approach involves:\nVisiting the first node, creating its clone, checking its neighbors, creating their clones, and connecting them accordingly. Continuing this process recursively. For example, with input adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]], we:\nVisit node 1, create its clone, check its neighbors (node 2), create its clone, and connect nodes 1 and 2.

If we draw a visual representation, we can find islands that are connected vertically or horizontally and surrounded by water.\nWhen the problem has adjacent elements, this means that it is a graph problem, and we have two common ways to solve it: using DFS or BFS algorithms.\nTo do that, we need to visit neighboring cells and check if they are part of the island (have \u0026quot;1\u0026quot;).\nThe function dfs will help us check for an out-of-bounds case and if we have already visited this cell. After that, we will mark the current cell as \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, meaning that we have visited this cell, and recursively call dfs to search neighbors in four directions.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(m*n) Space complexity: O(m*n) Where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid. Breadth-First Search Solution func numIslands(_ grid: [[Character]]) -\u0026gt; Int { let ROWS = grid.count let COLS = grid[0].count var visit: Set\u0026lt;[Int]\u0026gt; = [] var islands = 0 func bfs(_ r: Int, _ c: Int) { var q: [[Int]] = [] visit.insert([r, c]) q.append([r, c]) while !q.isEmpty { let val = q.removeFirst() let row = val[0] let col = val[1] let directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]] for direction in directions { let r = row + direction[0] let c = col + direction[1] if ((0 ..\u0026lt; ROWS).contains(r) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (0 ..\u0026lt; COLS).contains(c) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; grid[r][c] == \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !visit.contains([r, c]) ) { q.append([r, c]) visit.insert([r, c]) } } } } for r in 0 ..\u0026lt; ROWS { for c in 0 ..\u0026lt; COLS { if grid[r][c] == \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !visit.contains([r, c]) { bfs(r, c) islands += 1 } } } return islands } Explanation We can solve this problem using the BFS algorithm. The idea behind it is that we add an additional visit set and move layer by layer, starting from position (0,0).\nThe BFS algorithm is slightly different from DFS because it is iterative and uses a queue data structure. However, the logic remains the same: we visit neighboring cells in four directions only if\nwe are not out of bounds the cell is equal to \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; and we have not visited the cell before.

This algorithm allows us to visit neighboring cells.\nAccording to the problem description, we need to construct words from characters available on the board that match the input words.\nThe brute-force approach involves visiting each cell on the board and backtracking in four directions to try to construct possible words until we reach the bottom of the grid.\nHowever, this is not an efficient solution and will take O(m * n * 4^t + s). We can optimize this solution by using a Trie (Prefix Tree).\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(m * n * 4^t + s) Space complexity: O(t) where m is the number of rows, n is the number of columns, t is the maximum length of any word in the words array, and s is the sum of the lengths of all words.

To do this, we need a TrieNode class with an addWord helper method. For the findWords function, we need an additional depth-first search (backtracking) algorithm. The TrieNode will help us store words, while DFS will help us search for words on the board in four directions.\nIn a Prefix Tree, every single character is a node. We insert all input words into the Prefix Tree. For example, with words = [\u0026quot;app\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ape\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ace\u0026quot;]:\nAfter constructing the tree, we search for prefixes. If a prefix exists, we continue searching until we find a word or reach a base case. As a result, we find two words [\u0026quot;ape\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ace\u0026quot;] that can be built using the given board.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(m * n * 4 * 3^(t-1) + s) Space complexity: O(s) where m is the number of rows, n is the number of columns, t is the maximum length of any word in words, and s is the sum of the lengths of all words.

There will be at most 2 dots in word for search queries. At most 10^4 calls will be made to addWord and search. Brute force solution class WordDictionary { private var store: [String] init() { self.store = [] } func addWord(_ word: String) { self.store.append(word) } func search(_ word: String) -\u0026gt; Bool { let wordArray = Array(word) let wordCount = wordArray.count for w in self.store { let wArray = Array(w) let wCount = wArray.count if wCount != wordCount { continue } var i = 0 while i \u0026lt; wCount { if wArray[i] == wordArray[i] || wordArray[i] == \u0026#34;.\u0026#34; { i += 1 } else { break } if i == wCount { return true } } } return false } } Explanation We can solve this problem in a brute-force way by using an array.\nIt is not the most efficient solution because the search operation will take O(m * n) time. We can optimize it by using a Trie (Prefix Tree) data structure.\nFor the addWord method, we will use the append operation, which takes O(1) time. For search, we need a little more effort because we cannot only search for a specific word, but the input may contain dots ('.'), which can be matched with any letter. For example, if we have input [\u0026quot;c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;d\u0026quot;] and we are looking for “.d”, we will iterate through each element in store and compare it with the input word character by character, also checking if a character can be .. Time/space complexity Time complexity: O(1) for addWord, and O(m * n) for search. Space complexity: O(m * n),\nwhere m is the number of words added to the array and n is the length of the word. Trie (Prefix Tree) solution final class TrieNode { var children: [Character: TrieNode?] var endOfWord: Bool init() { self.children = [:] self.endOfWord = false } } class WordDictionary { private let root: TrieNode init() { self.root = TrieNode() } func addWord(_ word: String) { var curr = self.root for c in word { if curr.children[c] == nil { curr.children[c] = TrieNode() } curr = curr.children[c]!! } curr.endOfWord = true } func search(_ word: String) -\u0026gt; Bool { func dfs(_ j: Int, _ node: TrieNode) -\u0026gt; Bool { var curr = node let wordArray = Array(word) let wordCount = wordArray.count for i in j ..\u0026lt; wordCount { let c = wordArray[i] if c == \u0026#34;.\u0026#34; { for child in curr.children.values { if let childNode = child, dfs(i + 1, childNode) { return true } } return false } else { if curr.children[c] == nil { return false } curr = curr.children[c]!! } } return curr.endOfWord } return dfs(0, self.root) } } Explanation We can solve this problem in a more optimal way by using a Trie (Prefix Tree) data structure. It will help us decrease the time complexity for search from O(m * n) to O(n).\nTo do that, we need an additional class TrieNode that will store children nodes by character and an endOfWord property that will tell us when a sequence of characters forms a complete word.\nFor addWord, we iterate through all characters in the input word and mark it as the endOfWord. For search, we need to add a depth-first search (DFS) helper (backtracking). This allows us to search for a match in every node when we have . in the input because . matches any character.\nFor example, when we search for .ad and we have [\u0026quot;bad\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;dad\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mad\u0026quot;] as added words, we return true in all these cases because .ad matches all of them. This solution is more efficient because when we find a match, we return true and stop iterating, using recursion (DFS).\nTime/space complexity Time complexity: O(n) for addWord and search. Space complexity: O(t + n),\nwhere n is the length of the word and t is the total number of TrieNodes created in the Trie.

Prefix Tree Array solution final class TrieNode { var children: [TrieNode?] var endOfWord: Bool init() { self.children = Array(repeating: nil, count: 26) self.endOfWord = false } } class Trie { private let root: TrieNode private let aAsciiValue: Int = Int(Character(\u0026#34;a\u0026#34;).asciiValue!) init() { self.root = TrieNode() } func insert(_ word: String) { var curr = self.root for c in word { let i = Int(c.asciiValue!) - aAsciiValue if curr.children[i] == nil { curr.children[i] = TrieNode() } curr = curr.children[i]! } curr.endOfWord = true } func search(_ word: String) -\u0026gt; Bool { var curr = self.root for c in word { let i = Int(c.asciiValue!) - aAsciiValue if curr.children[i] == nil { return false } curr = curr.children[i]! } return curr.endOfWord } func startsWith(_ prefix: String) -\u0026gt; Bool { var curr = self.root for c in prefix { let i = Int(c.asciiValue!) - aAsciiValue if curr.children[i] == nil { return false } curr = curr.children[i]! } return true } } Explanation Before we start implementing Trie, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at what we are going to do.\nWe are going to create a node and insert it as a child of the previous character for every character of the word and mark it as the end of the word. To do that, we need an additional class TrieNode that will help us keep track of children nodes and endOfWord. When we want to search for a word, we need to iterate through the word character by character and check if it exists as a child and if it is marked as endOfWord. For example, with insert = \u0026quot;apple\u0026quot; and search = \u0026quot;apple\u0026quot;, the algorithm will return true because this word has the same characters and is marked as endOfWord. However, if we try insert = \u0026quot;apple\u0026quot; and search = \u0026quot;app\u0026quot;, the algorithm will return false even though the first three characters are the same. It does so because \u0026quot;app\u0026quot; is not marked as endOfWord. When we want to search for a word that startsWith a prefix, we need to iterate through the word character by character but without checking for endOfWord because we just need to find the prefix. For example, with insert = \u0026quot;apple\u0026quot; and searching for a word that startsWith = \u0026quot;app\u0026quot;, the algorithm will return true because this word has the same first three characters as the word \u0026quot;apple\u0026quot;. Time/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) for each method call Space complexity: O(t) where n is the length of the string and t is the total number of TrieNode objects created in the Trie. Prefix Tree HashMap solution final class TrieNode { var children: [Character: TrieNode?] var endOfWord: Bool init() { self.children = [:] self.endOfWord = false } } class Trie { private let root: TrieNode init() { self.root = TrieNode() } func insert(_ word: String) { var curr = self.root for c in word { if curr.children[c] == nil { curr.children[c] = TrieNode() } curr = curr.children[c]!! } curr.endOfWord = true } func search(_ word: String) -\u0026gt; Bool { var curr = self.root for c in word { if curr.children[c] == nil { return false } curr = curr.children[c]!! } return curr.endOfWord } func startsWith(_ prefix: String) -\u0026gt; Bool { var curr = self.root for c in prefix { if curr.children[c] == nil { return false } curr = curr.children[c]!! } return true } } Explanation We can also solve this problem by using a HashMap for TrieNode instead of an array as we did above. This will result in less code and will be easier to read. The algorithm behind the solution stays the same, as do the time and space complexity.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) for each method call Space complexity: O(t) where n is the length of the string and t is the total number of TrieNode objects created in the Trie.

Follow-up: Could you use search pruning to make your solution faster with a larger board?\nBacktracking Hash Set Solution func exist(_ board: [[Character]], _ word: String) -\u0026gt; Bool { let ROWS = board.count let COLS = board[0].count let word = Array(word) let wordCount = word.count var path: Set\u0026lt;[Int]\u0026gt; = [] func dfs(_ row: Int, _ col: Int, _ i: Int) -\u0026gt; Bool { if i == wordCount { return true } if (row \u0026lt; 0 || col \u0026lt; 0 || row \u0026gt;= ROWS || col \u0026gt;= COLS || word[i] != board[row][col] || path.contains([row, col])) { return false } path.insert([row, col]) let res = (dfs(row + 1, col, i + 1) || dfs(row - 1, col, i + 1) || dfs(row, col + 1, i + 1) || dfs(row, col - 1, i + 1)) path.remove([row, col]) return res } for r in 0..\u0026lt;ROWS { for c in 0..\u0026lt;COLS { if dfs(r, c, 0) { return true } } } return false } Explanation When a problem mentions a grid, matrix, or graph, it usually means that we need a backtracking algorithm because we can explore four different directions (top, left, right, down) to find neighboring cells.\nWe start from 0,0 (row and column) and try to move in different directions if possible. To do that, we use depth-first search (DFS) with a few base cases:\nIf i equals wordCount, we found the word. If the algorithm goes out of bounds of the board, return false. We insert our path, move recursively in four directions, and return the result. Time / Space Complexity Time Complexity: O(m * 4^n) Space Complexity: O(n) Where m is the number of cells in the board and n is the length of the word. Backtracking Optimized Solution func exist(_ board: [[Character]], _ word: String) -\u0026gt; Bool { let ROWS = board.count let COLS = board[0].count var board = board let wordArray = Array(word) let wordArrayCount = wordArray.count func dfs(_ r: Int, _ c: Int, _ i: Int) -\u0026gt; Bool { if i == wordArrayCount { return true } if r \u0026lt; 0 || c \u0026lt; 0 || r \u0026gt;= ROWS || c \u0026gt;= COLS || board[r][c] != wordArray[i] || board[r][c] == \u0026#34;#\u0026#34; { return false } let temp = board[r][c] board[r][c] = \u0026#34;#\u0026#34; let res = dfs(r + 1, c, i + 1) || dfs(r - 1, c, i + 1) || dfs(r, c + 1, i + 1) || dfs(r, c - 1, i + 1) board[r][c] = temp return res } for r in 0..\u0026lt;ROWS { for c in 0..\u0026lt;COLS { if dfs(r, c, 0) { return true } } } return false } Explanation We can optimize memory in the initial solution by removing the hash set and using input modification instead. We mark the value of the current cell with a # symbol so that we know it has been visited.

You may return the combinations in any order.\nThe same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.\nThe frequency of an element x is the number of times it occurs in the array.\nThe test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 for the given input.\nExamples Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7 Output: [[2,2,3],[7]] Explanation: 2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times. 7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7. These are the only two combinations.

Before diving into the code, the best way to understand the problem is to draw the decision tree.\nFor example, with the input [2,3,6,7] and target = 7, we cannot continue with 7 because adding it to any other value in the array would exceed the target.\nOne of the requirements is that we cannot have duplicate values. To enforce this, we construct a decision tree where:\nOne branch includes all possible occurrences of 2. The other branch skips 2 to avoid duplicates. We achieve this by adding and removing elements from the array and using recursion.\nTime/Space Complexity Time Complexity: O(2^{t/m}) Space Complexity: O(t/m) Where t is the given target and m is the minimum value in candidates.

We reduce the recursion call stack by adding an additional iteration.

If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.\nFor example, for arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3. For example, for arr = [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5. Implement the MedianFinder class:\nMedianFinder() initializes the MedianFinder object. void addNum(int num) adds the integer num from the data stream to the data structure. double findMedian() returns the median of all elements so far.

If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are in the range [0, 100], how would you optimize your solution?

To find the result, we use an array to collect all numbers added using the addNum method.\nBefore finding the median, we should sort the array first because the main requirement for calculating the median is an ordered list. After sorting, we check whether the length of data is odd or even and calculate the median accordingly.\nThis solution is not very efficient and takes O(m * n log n) time because we are using a built-in sorting algorithm. We can find a solution that is much faster.\nTime/Space Complexity Time Complexity: O(m) for addNum, O(m * n log n)forfindMedian` Space Complexity: O(n) Where m is the number of function calls and n is the length of the array.

We use additional collections from the Apple Swift package that provide a built-in Heap data structure. A heap can behave as either a Min-Heap or a Max-Heap.\nThe Heap solution is more efficient because it can insert elements in O(log n) time and find the min or max in O(1) time.\nTo solve this problem, we need two heaps:\nSmall Heap (Max-Heap) Large Heap (Min-Heap) We insert elements into one of the heaps, and if the condition small heap size ≤ large heap size is not satisfied, we move elements accordingly.\nFor example:\nsmall = [2, 7], large = [3] We find the max in small and remove it. We add it to large, so now small = [2], large = [3, 7]. Another condition:\nIf small heap size is less than large heap size: We find the min in large, remove it, and add it to small. Example: small = [2], large = [3, 7, 4] → small = [2, 3], large = [7, 4]. We calculate the median by finding the max value in small and min value in large.\nTime/Space Complexity Time Complexity: O(m * log n) for addNum, O(m) for findMedian Space Complexity: O(n) Where m is the number of function calls and n is the length of the array.

id=\"explanation\"\u003eExplanation\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne approach to solving this problem is to apply a built-in sorting algorithm. To find the result, we use an array to collect all numbers added using the \u003ccode\u003eaddNum\u003c/code\u003e method.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - Blind 75 - Find Median from Data Stream"},{"content":"The Problem Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.\nDesign an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.\nClarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.\nExamples Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5] Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5] Input: root = [] Output: [] Constraints The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10⁴]. -1000 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 1000 Depth-First Search Solution func serialize(_ root: TreeNode?) -\u0026gt; String { var res: [String] = [] func dfs(_ root: TreeNode?) { guard let root = root else { res.append(\u0026#34;nil\u0026#34;) return } res.append(String(root.val)) dfs(root.left) dfs(root.right) } dfs(root) return res.joined(separator: \u0026#34;,\u0026#34;) } func deserialize(_ data: String) -\u0026gt; TreeNode? { var values = data.components(separatedBy: \u0026#34;,\u0026#34;) var i = 0 func dfs() -\u0026gt; TreeNode? { if values[i] == \u0026#34;nil\u0026#34; { i += 1 return nil } let node = TreeNode(Int(values[i])!) i += 1 node.left = dfs() node.right = dfs() return node } return dfs() } Explanation The first step to solving this problem is serialize a node to a string: to do that, we need to find every value in the root node and decide how to represent null values. We will use \u0026quot;nil\u0026quot; for null, as this is the default behavior in Swift. To find the values, we use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm, adding found values to an array. After DFS completes, we join the values with a comma separator.\nThe second step is to deserialize the data. To do this, we split the input string using the same comma separator we used when serializing the node. We use a DFS algorithm to reconstruct the tree, with one base case to verify if the value is \u0026quot;nil\u0026quot;.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Breadth-First Search Solution func serialize(_ root: TreeNode?) -\u0026gt; String { if root == nil { return \u0026#34;nil\u0026#34; } var res: [String] = [] var queue: [TreeNode?] = [root] while !queue.isEmpty { let node = queue.removeFirst() if node == nil { res.append(\u0026#34;nil\u0026#34;) } else { res.append(String(node!.val)) queue.append(node!.left) queue.append(node!.right) } } return res.joined(separator: \u0026#34;,\u0026#34;) } func deserialize(_ data: String) -\u0026gt; TreeNode? { var values = data.components(separatedBy: \u0026#34;,\u0026#34;) if values[0] == \u0026#34;nil\u0026#34; { return nil } let root = TreeNode(Int(values[0])!) var queue: [TreeNode?] = [root] var idx = 1 while !queue.isEmpty { let node = queue.removeFirst() if values[idx] != \u0026#34;nil\u0026#34; { node?.left = TreeNode(Int(values[idx])!) queue.append(node?.left) } idx += 1 if values[idx] != \u0026#34;nil\u0026#34; { node?.right = TreeNode(Int(values[idx])!) queue.append(node?.right) } idx += 1 } return root } Explanation Another way to solve this problem is by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The string representation for null and the separator remain the same; we only change the underlying mechanism to traverse nodes when we serialize and find values to create new nodes when we deserialize the string.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe Problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesign an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree.

A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.\nThe path sum of a path is the sum of the node\u0026rsquo;s values in the path.\nGiven the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.\nExamples Input: root = [1,2,3] Output: 6 Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -\u0026gt; 1 -\u0026gt; 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6. Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7] Output: 42 Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -\u0026gt; 20 -\u0026gt; 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.

For example, with root = [1,2,null,null,3,4,5], we move from root 1 to the left 2. Since the left subtree only has one value, our max path equals 2.\nAfter that, we go to the right subtree, which looks like [3,4,5]. Now, we calculate the max path for the left and right subtrees; it will be 4 and 5, respectively.\nFinally, we go back up to the root and calculate our result.\nThis is not a very efficient solution as it takes O(n²) time.\nTime/Space Complexity Time Complexity: O(n²) Space Complexity: O(n) Optimized DFS Solution func maxPathSum(_ root: TreeNode?) -\u0026gt; Int { var res: Int = root!.val func dfs(_ root: TreeNode?) -\u0026gt; Int { guard let root = root else { return 0 } var leftMax = dfs(root.left) var rightMax = dfs(root.right) leftMax = max(leftMax, 0) rightMax = max(rightMax, 0) res = max(res, root.val + leftMax + rightMax) return root.val + max(leftMax, rightMax) } dfs(root) return res } Explanation We can optimize the brute force DFS solution by eliminating the unnecessary recursion of the getMax helper function. All we need is to replace the getMax function with the built-in max function and return root.val + max(leftMax, rightMax). The rest remains the same.\nTime/Space Complexity Time Complexity: O(n) Space Complexity: O(n) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe Problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them.

For example, with the input preorder = [3,9,20,15,7], the root is always the first element in the array (in this case, 3). Knowing this, we can recursively reconstruct the left and right subtrees.\nInorder Traversal:\nInorder traversal starts with the left subtree first, then moves to the root, and after that to the right subtree. For example, with the input inorder = [9,3,15,20,7], every value to the left of the root belongs to the left subtree, and every value to the right of the root belongs to the right subtree.\nUsing this information, we can find the root and then partition the arrays into subarrays to reconstruct the tree.\nThis is not a very efficient solution and takes O(n^2) time and space, but we can optimize it.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n^2) Space complexity: O(n^2) DFS Optimal Solution func buildTree(_ preorder: [Int], _ inorder: [Int]) -\u0026gt; TreeNode? { var indices: [Int: Int] = [:] for (i, v) in inorder.enumerated() { indices.updateValue(i, forKey: v) } var preIdx = 0 func dfs(_ l: Int, _ r: Int) -\u0026gt; TreeNode? { if l \u0026gt; r { return nil } let rootVal = preorder[preIdx] preIdx += 1 let root = TreeNode(rootVal) let mid = indices[rootVal]! root.left = dfs(l, mid - 1) root.right = dfs(mid + 1, r) return root } return dfs(0, inorder.count - 1) } Explanation We can solve this problem in a more optimal way by using the DFS algorithm and a hashmap. The logic behind the solution stays the same: we find the root value from the preorder array, then find the mid index in the inorder array, and build the tree using recursion.\nTime/Space Complexity

Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. In this problem, we can use inorder traversal.\nInorder traversal visits the left subtree first, then the parent node, and finally all nodes in the right subtree. Knowing this, we can use it to our advantage to solve this problem efficiently.\nIn our case, for the root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1, the arr will look like [1, 2, 3, 4], and the result will be 1.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Iterative DFS Solution func kthSmallest(_ root: TreeNode?, _ k: Int) -\u0026gt; Int { var stack: [TreeNode] = [] var curr = root var visitedCount = 0 while !stack.isEmpty || curr != nil { while curr != nil { stack.append(curr!) curr = curr!.left } curr = stack.removeLast() visitedCount += 1 if visitedCount == k { return curr!.val } curr = curr!.right } return -1 // This line should ideally never be reached due to constraints. } Explanation We can solve this problem using another approach: iterative DFS. This involves maintaining a stack to handle left subtree nodes first, then checking the parent node, and finally moving to the right subtree.\nThe space complexity is the same as the recursive inorder DFS solution due to the additional stack data structure.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe Problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the \u003ccode\u003eroot\u003c/code\u003e of a binary search tree and an integer \u003ccode\u003ek\u003c/code\u003e, return the \u003ccode\u003ekth\u003c/code\u003e smallest value (1-indexed) among all the values of the nodes in the tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"examples\"\u003eExamples\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-6ddd2\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-6ddd2\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/kthtree1.jpg#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1\nOutput: 1\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-e4401\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-e4401\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/kthtree2.jpg#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eInput: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3\nOutput: 3\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"constraints\"\u003eConstraints\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe number of nodes in the tree is \u003ccode\u003en\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1 \u0026lt;= k \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 10⁴\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e0 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 10⁴\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFollow-up:\u003c/strong\u003e If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can perform insert and delete operations) and you need to find the \u003ccode\u003ekth\u003c/code\u003e smallest element frequently, how would you optimize?\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - Blind 75 - Kth Smallest Element in a BST"},{"content":"The Problem Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).\nA valid BST is defined as follows:\nThe left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node\u0026rsquo;s key. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node\u0026rsquo;s key. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. A subtree of treeName is a tree consisting of a node in treeName and all of its descendants.\nExamples Input: root = [2,1,3] Output: true Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6] Output: false Explanation: The root node\u0026#39;s value is 5, but its right child\u0026#39;s value is 4.

The DFS algorithm allows us to retrieve the left and right subtree node values and determine if the root node is a valid BST.\nTo do this, we need to check a few base cases:\nIf the node is nil, this means it is a valid node. If the condition (node!.val \u0026lt; right \u0026amp;\u0026amp; node!.val \u0026gt; left) is false, this means it is an invalid BST. You can see that in the valid method, we have left and right parameters. We use them as boundaries for our verification condition.\nFor example, with root = [2,1,3]:\nWe start with left = Int.min and right = Int.max, so our condition Int.min \u0026lt; 2 \u0026lt; Int.max is true. Next, we move to the left subtree with value 1. Now, our condition looks like this: Int.min \u0026lt; 1 \u0026lt; 2, which is also true. Finally, we look at the right subtree with value 3, and the condition 2 \u0026lt; 3 \u0026lt; Int.max is also true. Time/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Breadth-First Search Solution func isValidBST(_ root: TreeNode?) -\u0026gt; Bool { if root == nil { return true } var queue = [(root, Int.min, Int.max)] while !queue.isEmpty { let (node, left, right) = queue.removeFirst() if !(node!.val \u0026lt; right \u0026amp;\u0026amp; node!.val \u0026gt; left) { return false } if node?.left != nil { queue.append((node!.left, left, node!.val)) } if node?.right != nil { queue.append((node!.right, node!.val, right)) } } return true } Explanation We can solve this problem in another way by using the BFS algorithm. The BFS algorithm allows us to move level by level and determine the node, left, and right values.\nThe condition for validation remains the same.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-validate-binary-search-tree/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe Problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the \u003ccode\u003eroot\u003c/code\u003e of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA \u003cstrong\u003evalid BST\u003c/strong\u003e is defined as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys \u003cstrong\u003eless than\u003c/strong\u003e the node\u0026rsquo;s key.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys \u003cstrong\u003egreater than\u003c/strong\u003e the node\u0026rsquo;s key.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBoth the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA \u003cstrong\u003esubtree\u003c/strong\u003e of \u003ccode\u003etreeName\u003c/code\u003e is a tree consisting of a node in \u003ccode\u003etreeName\u003c/code\u003e and all of its descendants.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - Blind 75 - Validate Binary Search Tree"},{"content":"The Problem Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes\u0026rsquo; values (i.e., from left to right, level by level).\nExamples Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7] Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]] Input: root = [1] Output: [[1]] Input: root = [] Output: [] Constraints The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000]. -1000 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 1000 BFS Solution func levelOrder(_ root: TreeNode?) -\u0026gt; [[Int]] { if root == nil { return [] } var queue: [TreeNode?] = [] queue.append(root) var res: [[Int]] = [] while !queue.isEmpty { var level: [Int] = [] for _ in 0 ..\u0026lt; queue.count { let node = queue.removeFirst() if let node = node { level.append(node.val) queue.append(node.left) queue.append(node.right) } } if !level.isEmpty { res.append(level) } } return res } Explanation When you see that a binary tree problem involves level order traversal, it means the solution usually implies the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.

(BFS) algorithm. BFS is a common solution to this problem because, according to Wikipedia, breadth-first search is also called “level-order search.” The core idea behind BFS is to iterate level by level from top to bottom, and from left to right.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - Blind 75 - Binary Tree Level Order Traversal"},{"content":"The Problem Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.\nAccording to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”\nExamples Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8 Output: 6 Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4 Output: 2 Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition. Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1 Output: 2 Constraints The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10⁵]. -10⁹ \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 10⁹ All Node.val are unique. p != q p and q will exist in the BST.

Iterative Solution func lowestCommonAncestor(_ root: TreeNode?, _ p: TreeNode?, _ q: TreeNode?) -\u0026gt; TreeNode? { var curr = root if p == nil { return nil } if q == nil { return nil } while curr != nil { if p!.val \u0026lt; curr!.val \u0026amp;\u0026amp; q!.val \u0026lt; curr!.val { curr = curr?.left } else if p!.val \u0026gt; curr!.val \u0026amp;\u0026amp; q!.val \u0026gt; curr!.val { curr = curr?.right } else { return curr } } return root } Explanation We can solve this problem using iteration. This solution is more memory-efficient because you don’t have recursive stack calls that take additional memory.\nThe algorithm looks like this:\nCompare p and q values with the curr value. If they are less than curr, move to the left subtree. If they are greater than curr, move to the right subtree. If one is less and the other is greater (or either equals curr), we’ve found the LCA.

Binary Tree"},{"content":"The problem You are given an array of k linked lists lists, each linked list is sorted in ascending order.\nMerge all the linked lists into one sorted linked list and return it.\nExamples Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]] Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6] Explanation: The linked lists are: [ 1-\u0026gt;4-\u0026gt;5, 1-\u0026gt;3-\u0026gt;4, 2-\u0026gt;6 ] merging them into one sorted list: 1-\u0026gt;1-\u0026gt;2-\u0026gt;3-\u0026gt;4-\u0026gt;4-\u0026gt;5-\u0026gt;6 Input: lists = [] Output: [] Input: lists = [[]] Output: [] Constraints k == lists.length 0 \u0026lt;= k \u0026lt;= 10^4 0 \u0026lt;= lists[i].length \u0026lt;= 500 -10^4 \u0026lt;= lists[i][j] \u0026lt;= 10^4 lists[i] is sorted in ascending order. The sum of lists[i].length will not exceed 10^4. Brute Force Solution func mergeKLists(_ lists: [ListNode?]) -\u0026gt; ListNode? { var nodes: [Int] = [] // Step 1 for i in 0..\u0026lt;lists.count { var lst = lists[i] while lst != nil { nodes.append(lst!.val) lst = lst?.next } } // Step 2 nodes.sort() // Step 3 var res = ListNode(0) var curr: ListNode? = res for node in nodes { curr?.next = ListNode(node) curr = curr?.next } return res.next } Explanation We can solve this problem by separating it into three steps:\nFind all node values in the lists: This way, we can create an unsorted single list. Sort the created list: This allows us to form a sorted linked list. Create a sorted linked list from the sorted values. Time/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n * m) where n is the length of lists and m is the length of the linked lists. Space complexity: O(n). Solution 2 func mergeKLists(_ lists: [ListNode?]) -\u0026gt; ListNode? { if lists.isEmpty { return nil } var lists = lists while lists.count \u0026gt; 1 { var mergedLists: [ListNode?] = [] for i in stride(from: 0, to: lists.count, by: 2) { var l1 = lists[i] var l2: ListNode? if i + 1 \u0026lt; lists.count { l2 = lists[i + 1] } mergedLists.append(merge(l1, l2)) } lists = mergedLists } return lists[0] } func merge(_ l1: ListNode?, _ l2: ListNode?) -\u0026gt; ListNode? { let dummyNode = ListNode() var l1 = l1 var l2 = l2 var tail: ListNode? = dummyNode while l1 != nil \u0026amp;\u0026amp; l2 != nil { if l1!.val \u0026lt; l2!.val { tail?.next = l1 l1 = l1!.next } else { tail?.next = l2 l2 = l2!.next } tail = tail?.next } tail?.next = l1 ?? l2 return dummyNode.next } Explanation We can solve this problem by dividing it into sub-problems:\nFind the first and second linked lists: Iterate through lists.count until it equals 1, using stride with step = 2 to find the first and second portions of the linked lists. Merge them: Use the merge function for linked lists, which is a common problem in itself. Time/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n * log k) Space complexity: O(k)\nWhere k is the total number of lists, and n is the total number of nodes across k lists.

Lists"},{"content":"The Problem Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.\nThere is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that the tail\u0026rsquo;s next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.\nReturn true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.\nExamples Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1 Output: true Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed). Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0 Output: true Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node. Input: head = [1], pos = -1 Output: false Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

We start from the beginning of head and move the slow pointer by one step and the fast pointer by two steps.\nFor example, in the case of input [1, 2, 3, 4] with pos = 1 (which corresponds to the value 2), the fast and slow pointers will eventually meet at the same position with value 2.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(1) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-linked-list-cycle/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe Problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven \u003ccode\u003ehead\u003c/code\u003e, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.\u003cbr\u003e\nThere is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the \u003ccode\u003enext\u003c/code\u003e pointer.

We create an offset between the left and right pointers by looking at the nth node. The right pointer is shifted by n, while the left pointer starts from 0 and moves by 1. When the right pointer becomes nil, the left pointer will point to the node we need to delete.\nFor example, for the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and n = 2, at the start, the left pointer will be at 1, and the right pointer will be at 3. We keep shifting pointers until the right pointer reaches the end of the list. At this point, the left pointer will be at 4, and the right pointer will be nil.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(1) Thank you for reading! 😊

Then we compare the node values and move the next pointer accordingly.\nFor example, with input list1 = [1,2,4] and list2 = [1,3,5], we first move the list1.next pointer because the condition list1.val \u0026lt;= list2.val with values 1 and 1 is true. The output at this step looks like 1. After that, we move list2.next because the list1 input now equals 2 and the condition list1.val \u0026lt;= list2.val becomes false.\nTime and Space Complexity Time Complexity: O(n) Space Complexity: O(n) Iterative Solution func mergeTwoLists(_ list1: ListNode?, _ list2: ListNode?) -\u0026gt; ListNode? { let dummyNode = ListNode() var list1 = list1 var list2 = list2 var tail: ListNode? = dummyNode while list1 != nil \u0026amp;\u0026amp; list2 != nil { if list1!.val \u0026lt; list2!.val { tail?.next = list1 list1 = list1?.next } else { tail?.next = list2 list2 = list2?.next } tail = tail?.next } tail?.next = list1 ?? list2 return dummyNode.next } Explanation The iterative solution uses the same logic as the recursive one with an additional trick: the dummyNode. This helps avoid edge cases related to the initialization of the node. This solution is memory-efficient (O(1)) because it does not require additional memory allocation.\nTime and Space Complexity Time Complexity: O(n) Space Complexity: O(1) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-merge-two-sorted-lists/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe Problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are given the heads of two sorted linked lists, \u003ccode\u003elist1\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003elist2\u003c/code\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\nMerge the two lists into one \u003cstrong\u003esorted\u003c/strong\u003e list.

Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].\nGiven the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.\nExamples Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2] Output: 1 Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

Brute Force Solution func findMin(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { return nums.min()! } Explanation The easiest way to solve this problem is to use Swift\u0026rsquo;s built-in min function, but it takes O(n) time.

Since we are using a rotated array as input, we use the condition\nnums[m] \u0026gt;= nums[l] to look into the left or right side of the input nums and update pointers. For example, if we have the rotated array [3, 4, 5, 1, 2], our middle pointer will be 5, and the left pointer will be 3. Following the condition nums[m] \u0026gt;= nums[l], we update the left pointer.

Let\u0026rsquo;s divide it into parts to help us understand it more deeply.\nBefore we find the result, we need to calculate the count for each character in the t string. This will help us find a similar substring in s.\nNow, when we have our count of t, we can compare it with the count of s and update our result. This is not a very efficient solution, and we can minimize repetitive work—“iterating through the input every iteration”—by getting rid of the second loop and applying the sliding window technique.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n²) Space complexity: O(m), where m is the total number of unique characters in strings s and t. Solution 2 - Optimal func minWindow(_ s: String, _ t: String) -\u0026gt; String { if t.isEmpty { return \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } var countT: [Character: Int] = [:] for c in t { countT[c, default: 0] += 1 } var window: [Character: Int] = [:] var res = (-1, -1) var resLen = Int.max let sArray = Array(s) let lenS = sArray.count var have = 0 let need = countT.count var l = 0 for r in 0 ..\u0026lt; lenS { let c = sArray[r] window[c, default: 0] += 1 if countT[c] != nil \u0026amp;\u0026amp; window[c] == countT[c] { have += 1 } while have == need { let windowSize = (r - l + 1) if windowSize \u0026lt; resLen { res = (l, r) resLen = windowSize } window[sArray[l], default: 0] -= 1 if countT[sArray[l]] != nil \u0026amp;\u0026amp; window[sArray[l], default: 0] \u0026lt; countT[sArray[l], default: 0] { have -= 1 } l += 1 } } l = res.0 let r = res.1 if resLen == Int.max { return \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } else { return String(sArray[l...r]) } } Explanation To solve this problem in an optimal way, we need to add two additional properties: have and need. These will help us determine when to move our pointers.\nThe need variable is simply the count of all characters inside the countT dictionary.\nhave is the number of characters in the current window that satisfy the condition.\nWe update the have property only when the value of window is equal to the value of countT. For example, a substring of s with \u0026ldquo;ADOB\u0026rdquo; and a substring of t with \u0026ldquo;ABC\u0026rdquo; will have:\nwindow with A: 1, B: 1, and countT with A: 1, B: 1, C: 1.\nWhen the condition have == need is satisfied, we update the result and move the pointers.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(m), where m is the total number of unique characters in strings s and t.

We can do this by using a dictionary. This way, we can calculate the most frequent character in the substring.

The logic stays the same. What we did is store properties from the inner loop outside. In case numOfCharsToReplace is more than k, it means we exceeded the allowed number of replacements. We then need to shrink our window by decrementing the count of the current character and moving the l pointer.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(m), where m is the total number of unique characters in the string.

which character we are going to replace. We can do this by using a dictionary. This way, we can calculate the most frequent character in the substring. After that, we will be able to calculate the number of characters to replace and check if we can replace the character.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis algorithm is not very fast and takes O(n^2) time. We can improve it further and optimize it to achieve O(n) time complexity.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"LeetCode - Blind 75 - Longest Repeating Character Replacement"},{"content":"The Problem Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\nA substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.\nExamples Input: s = \u0026#34;abcabcbb\u0026#34; Output: 3 Explanation: The answer is \u0026#34;abc\u0026#34;, with the length of 3.

Input: s = \u0026#34;pwwkew\u0026#34; Output: 3 Explanation: The answer is \u0026#34;wke\u0026#34;, with the length of 3. Notice that the answer must be a substring. \u0026#34;pwke\u0026#34; is a subsequence and not a substring. Constraints 0 \u0026lt;= s.length \u0026lt;= 5 * 10⁴ s consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces. Brute Force Solution func lengthOfLongestSubstring(_ s: String) -\u0026gt; Int { let n = s.count var res = 0 for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; n { var chars: [Character] = [] for j in i ..\u0026lt; n { if chars.contains(s[j]) { break } chars.append(s[j]) } res = max(res, chars.count) } return res } Explanation Let’s start by visualizing the problem:\nWe can compare every substring starting from the first element, iterating through all elements, and when we find a duplicate character, we update the result with the length of the substring.\nThis is not an efficient solution and will take O(n * m) time. We can optimize it with the sliding window technique.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n * m) - where n is the length of the string and m is the number of unique characters in the substring. Space complexity: O(m) Solution 2 - Sliding Window func lengthOfLongestSubstring(_ s: String) -\u0026gt; Int { let n = s.count let s = Array(s) var res = 0 var charSet: Set\u0026lt;Character\u0026gt; = [] var l = 0 for r in 0 ..\u0026lt; n { while charSet.contains(s[r]) { charSet.remove(s[l]) l += 1 } charSet.insert(s[r]) let windowSize = (r - l + 1) res = max(res, windowSize) } return res } Explanation As mentioned above, we can optimize our brute force solution by using the sliding window technique.\nWe control the window using a set data structure to eliminate duplicates.\nWhen we find a duplicate value during iteration, we remove that value from the set and move the left pointer to form a new window.\nBy iterating through all the input, we can find the length of the longest substring.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(m) - where m is the number of unique characters in the substring.

array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the i-th day.\nYou want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.\nReturn the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.\nExamples Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4] Output: 5 Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5. Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell. Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1] Output: 0 Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0. Constraints 1 \u0026lt;= prices.length \u0026lt;= 10⁵ 0 \u0026lt;= prices[i] \u0026lt;= 10⁴ Brute force solution func maxProfit(_ prices: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { let n = prices.count var res = 0 for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; n { for j in i + 1 ..\u0026lt; n { let profit = prices[j] - prices[i] if profit \u0026gt; 0 { res = max(res, profit) } } } return res } Explanation We can start with a brute force solution and find a way to a more optimal solution as we go.\nBy visualizing the problem using input from example 1 [7,1,5,3,6,4]:\nWe can see that the maximum profit is possible if you buy on day 2 for price 1 and sell on day 5 at price 6, resulting in a profit of 5.\nWe can iterate over all prices, compare the current price with the next one, and calculate the profit. This will work with a time complexity of O(n²), but we can do better by using the two-pointer technique.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n²) Space complexity: O(1) Solution 2 - Two Pointers func maxProfit(_ prices: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { let n = prices.count var res = 0 var l = 0 var r = 1 while r \u0026lt; n { let profit = prices[r] - prices[l] if profit \u0026gt; 0 { res = max(res, profit) } else { l = r } r += 1 } return res } Explanation From the brute force approach, we learned that it is possible to solve this problem in a more optimal way by using the two-pointer technique. The calculation of profit remains the same, but the solution is optimized to O(n) time complexity.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(1) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are given an array \u003ccode\u003eprices\u003c/code\u003e where \u003ccode\u003eprices[i]\u003c/code\u003e is the price of a given stock on the \u003ccode\u003ei-th\u003c/code\u003e day.\u003cbr\u003e\nYou want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.\u003cbr\u003e\nReturn the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction.

There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).\nFind two lines that, together with the x-axis, form a container such that the container contains the most water.\nReturn the maximum amount of water a container can store.\nNotice that you may not slant the container.\nExamples Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7] Output: 49 Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by the array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49. Input: height = [1,1] Output: 1 Constraints n == height.length 2 \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 105 0 \u0026lt;= height[i] \u0026lt;= 104 Brute Force Solution func maxArea(_ height: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { let n = height.count var res = 0 for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; n { for j in i + 1 ..\u0026lt; n { let areaWidth = (j - i) let minHeight = min(height[i], height[j]) let area = minHeight * areaWidth res = max(res, area) } } return res } Explanation Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the brute force solution.\nBy looking at the picture of Example 1, we can see that the area with height 7 and width 7 holds the most water. To get to this step, we compare the current and the next elements to find a solution. For example, in [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7], when we compare 1 and 8, we look for the maximum area of water. We can see that the area will be 1 by 1 because the water spills to the left.\nBy following this example and continuing the iterations, we calculate the area width, minimum height, the area filled with water, and find the result.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n^2) Space complexity: O(1) Solution 2 - Two Pointers func maxArea(_ height: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { let n = height.count var res = 0 var l = 0 var r = n - 1 while l \u0026lt; r { let areaWidth = (r - l) let minHeight = min(height[l], height[r]) let area = minHeight * areaWidth res = max(res, area) if height[l] \u0026lt; height[r] { l += 1 } else { r -= 1 } } return res } Explanation When we solved this problem using the brute force method, we saw that it could be done with two loops. Now, we can take it further and optimize it to O(n) time complexity using the two-pointer technique.\nThe computation of the max area stays the same: we calculate the area width, minimum height, area, and move pointers by comparing the left and right height elements.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(1) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-container-with-most-water/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe Problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are given an integer array \u003ccode\u003eheight\u003c/code\u003e of length \u003ccode\u003en\u003c/code\u003e.

By looking at examples, the first thing that comes to mind is to use three loops, add each of the elements, and compare the result with 0. If the result equals 0, we add the elements to the result.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n³) Space complexity: O(m), where m is the number of triplets. Solution 2 - Optimal func threeSum(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; [[Int]] { var nums = nums let n = nums.count var res: [[Int]] = [] nums.sort() for (i, num) in nums.enumerated() { if i \u0026gt; 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num == nums[i - 1] { continue } var l = i + 1 var r = n - 1 while l \u0026lt; r { let tSum = num + nums[l] + nums[r] if tSum \u0026gt; 0 { r -= 1 } else if tSum \u0026lt; 0 { l += 1 } else { res.append([num, nums[l], nums[r]]) l += 1 while nums[l] == nums[l - 1] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; l \u0026lt; r { l += 1 } } } } return res } Explanation The time complexity of O(n³) is not exactly blazingly fast, so we need a better approach. An optimal solution is exactly what we are looking for.\nUsing sorting, we can detect duplicate values. For example, before sorting: [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4], and after sorting: [-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2]. We can iterate and check in the base case if the current value is equal to the previous one, and if it is, skip and move to the next iteration.\nWe can find the second and third elements by using the two-pointer technique. We determine which pointer to move by calculating the total sum of the triplet and comparing it to 0.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n²) Space complexity: O(1) or O(n), depending on the sorting algorithm.

According to the description, we need to check if the string contains only lowercase, alphanumeric characters and reads the same forward and backward. In Swift, you can check this using the built-in isLetter and isNumber properties.

We can accomplish this by introducing an isAlnum helper function that checks if a character is alphanumeric within the loop, using the two-pointer technique. For example, in the array \u0026quot;car rac\u0026quot;, the first left and right characters are both \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;, the second are both \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, and the third are both \u0026quot;r\u0026quot;. Following this logic, we can confirm that the input string s is a palindrome.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(1) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leetcode-blind-75-valid-palindrome/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe Problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven a string \u003ccode\u003es\u003c/code\u003e, return \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e if it is a palindrome, or \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.\nA consecutive sequence is a sequence of elements in which each element is exactly 1 greater than the previous element.\nExamples Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2] Output: 4 Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4. Input: nums = [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1] Output: 9 Constraints 0 \u0026lt;= nums.length \u0026lt;= 10^5 -10^9 \u0026lt;= nums[i] \u0026lt;= 10^9 Brute Force Solution func longestConsecutive(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { var res = 0 let setOfNums: Set\u0026lt;Int\u0026gt; = Set(nums) for num in nums { var streak = 0 var curr = num while setOfNums.contains(curr) { streak += 1 curr += 1 } res = max(res, streak) } return res } Explanation Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the brute force solution. We need to increment each element by 1 to check if the incremented value exists in our input array. For example, if we have an array nums with [3, 2, 1, 100, 5], the longest consecutive sequence will be 3.\nIf you look closely at the array [3, 2, 1, 100, 5], it has a sequence of 2, 1, which when incremented forms elements that already exist in the array (1 -\u0026gt; 2, 2 -\u0026gt; 3). By counting the number of increments, you can determine the longest sequence. The solution above does exactly that:\nIterates through the array of nums Checks if the element exists in the array and updates streak by 1 Calculates the max of res and streak Returns the result This solution uses a set to avoid duplicate values, which could lead to incorrect results.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n^2) Space complexity: O(n) Solution - 2 - Sorting func longestConsecutive(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { if nums.isEmpty { return 0 } let n = nums.count var nums = nums nums.sort() var res = 0 var curr = nums[0] var streak = 0 var i = 0 while i \u0026lt; n { if curr != nums[i] { curr = nums[i] streak = 0 } while i \u0026lt; n \u0026amp;\u0026amp; nums[i] == curr { i += 1 } streak += 1 curr += 1 res = max(res, streak) } return res } Explanation The next way to solve this problem is by sorting. Sorting will transform your array, for example [3, 2, 1, 100, 5] to [1, 2, 3, 5, 100]. In this case, the longest sequence will be on the left side of the array, so you can iterate from left to right to find the result.\nThe condition if curr != nums[i] checks if curr value is not the same as the element nums[i] and resets the streak. The following steps are similar to the brute force solution.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n log n) Space complexity: O(1) Solution - 3 - Optimal func longestConsecutive(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; Int { var longestSCount = 0 let setOfNums: Set\u0026lt;Int\u0026gt; = Set(nums) for num in setOfNums { if !setOfNums.contains(num - 1) { var length = 0 while setOfNums.contains(num + length) { length += 1 } longestSCount = max(length, longestSCount) } } return longestSCount } Explanation Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the optimal solution using the example input [1, 2, 3, 5, 100]. When you look at it, you can recognise patterns such as elements 2, 3 having a neighbor on the left side. If you decrement each of them by 1, you will see that values (1 \u0026lt;- 2, 2 \u0026lt;- 3) have a neighbor. After that, all you need is to calculate the length of the longest sequence.\nThis solution also uses a set to avoid duplicate values, which would cause incorrect results.\nTime/Space Complexity Time

We need to increment each element by \u003ccode\u003e1\u003c/code\u003e to check if the incremented value exists in our input array. For example, if we have an array \u003ccode\u003enums\u003c/code\u003e with \u003ccode\u003e[3, 2, 1, 100, 5]\u003c/code\u003e, the longest consecutive sequence will be \u003ccode\u003e3\u003c/code\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you look closely at the array \u003ccode\u003e[3, 2, 1, 100, 5]\u003c/code\u003e, it has a sequence of \u003ccode\u003e2, 1\u003c/code\u003e, which when incremented forms elements that already exist in the array \u003ccode\u003e(1 -\u0026gt; 2, 2 -\u0026gt; 3)\u003c/code\u003e. By counting the number of increments, you can determine the longest sequence.

Time/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n^2) Space complexity: O(1) Solution - 2 - Division func productExceptSelf(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; [Int] { let n = nums.count var val = 1 var zeroCnt = 0 for num in nums { if num != 0 { val *= num } else { zeroCnt += 1 } } if zeroCnt \u0026gt; 1 { return [Int](repeating: 0, count: n) } var res = [Int](repeating: 0, count: n) for (i, c) in nums.enumerated() { if zeroCnt != 0 { if c != 0 { res[i] = 0 } else { res[i] = val } } else { res[i] = val / c } } return res } Explanation Solution - 2:\nIterates through all elements in input nums and multiplies val with num if the element is not equal to 0; if it is, increments zeroCnt. Checks if zeroCnt is more than 1; if it is, returns an array with 0 elements with length of n, otherwise moves to the next step. Iterates through enumerated nums and checks if zeroCnt is not equal to 0; if so, it divides val by c. If zeroCnt is 0, checks if c does not equal 0 and sets res[i] to val; if it does, sets 0 to res[i]. Returns result. Time/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(1) Solution - 3 - Prefix/Postfix func productExceptSelf(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; [Int] { let n = nums.count var res = [Int](repeating: 0, count: n) var prefix = [Int](repeating: 0, count: n) var suffix = [Int](repeating: 0, count: n) prefix[0] = 1 suffix[n - 1] = 1 for i in 1 ..\u0026lt; n { prefix[i] = nums[i - 1] * prefix[i - 1] } for i in stride(from: n - 2, to: -1, by: -1) { suffix[i] = nums[i + 1] * suffix[i + 1] } for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; n { res[i] = prefix[i] * suffix[i] } return res } Explanation Solution - 3:\nInitializes res, prefix, and suffix arrays. Updates the first prefix element with 1. Updates the last suffix element with 1. Iterates from 0 to n (excluded); updates prefix[i] with the product of num and prefix elements at index i - 1. Iterates in reverse from n - 2 to -1; updates suffix[i] with the product of num and suffix elements at index i + 1. Iterates from 0 to n (excluded); updates res[i] with the product of prefix and suffix elements at index i. Time/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Solution - 4 - Prefix/Postfix (Optimized) func productExceptSelf(_ nums: [Int]) -\u0026gt; [Int] { let n = nums.count var res = [Int](repeating: 1, count: n) var prefix = 1 for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; n { res[i] = prefix prefix *= nums[i] } var postfix = 1 for i in stride(from: n - 1, to: -1, by: -1) { res[i] *= postfix postfix *= nums[i] } return res } Explanation Solution - 4:\nIterates through the range of indices from 0 to n (excluded). Sets prefix to res[i]. Multiplies prefix with the element of nums[i]. Iterates in reversed order. Sets postfix to res[i]. Multiplies postfix with the element of nums[i]. Returns result.

Otherwise, compare the sorted s and t strings and return the result.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: Depends on the sorting algorithm, on average O(N log N).

In the final step, it returns the result of comparing the two dictionaries.\nTime/Space Complexity Time complexity: O(N) - iterates through the entire string.

In the next step, it iterates through the array of encoded utf8 t elements, calculates the character index, and decrements the count of that specific character. The last step is to iterate through the count array and check if any val is not equal to 0; if so, it returns false (indicating an extra character was found, and it is no longer an anagram).

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.\nExample Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 Output: [0,1] Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Loop while j is greater than 0 and the element at index j - 1 is greater than the element at index j: Swap the elements at index j and j - 1. Decrement j by 1. Why use Insertion Sort? Fast for small data sets. More efficient in practice than most other algorithms, such as selection sort or bubble sort. Adaptive: Efficient for datasets that are already substantially sorted; the time complexity is O(kn) when each element in the input is no more than k places away from its sorted position. Stable: Does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys. In-place: Only requires O(1) of additional memory space. Online: Can sort a list as it receives it.

Merge sort is a recursive algorithm that uses the divide and conquer algorithm design paradigm to find the solution.\nsource\nThe merge sort conceptually consists of two separate functions: mergeSort and merge.

I will be focusing on the top-down implementation using lists.\nCode Example func mergeSort(_ array: [Int]) -\u0026gt; [Int] { if array.count \u0026lt; 2 { return array } let sortedLeftSide = mergeSort(Array(array[0 ..\u0026lt; array.count / 2])) let sortedRightSide = mergeSort(Array(array[array.count / 2 ..\u0026lt; array.count])) return merge(sortedLeftSide, sortedRightSide) } func merge(_ first: [Int], _ second: [Int]) -\u0026gt; [Int] { var result: [Int] = [] var i = 0 var j = 0 while i \u0026lt; first.count \u0026amp;\u0026amp; j \u0026lt; second.count { if first[i] \u0026lt;= second[j] { result.append(first[i]) i += 1 } else { result.append(second[j]) j += 1 } } while i \u0026lt; first.count { result.append(first[i]) i += 1 } while j \u0026lt; second.count { result.append(second[j]) j += 1 } return result } Explanation mergeSort method: If the array’s count is less than 2, it means the array is already sorted and is returned as-is. Splits the array into two halves down the middle. Recursively calls the mergeSort method on the left side of the split array. Recursively calls the mergeSort method on the right side of the split array. Returns the result of the merge method with sortedLeftSide and sortedRightSide properties. merge method: Creates a result list of integers. Sets i and j pointers to zero. Uses a loop to iterate over both the first and second input arrays. If an element in first is less than or equal to the respective element in second, it adds it to the final list and increments i. Otherwise, it adds the item from second to the final list and increments j. After comparing all the items, if there are any leftover elements in either first or second, it adds them to the result. Time Complexity This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n).\nThank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/dsa-sorting-merge-sort/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-merge-sort\"\u003eWhat is Merge Sort?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort\"\u003eMerge sort\u003c/a\u003e is a recursive algorithm that uses the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm\"\u003edivide and conquer\u003c/a\u003e algorithm design paradigm to find the solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-438f5\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-438f5\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/Merge-sort-example-300px.gif#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort#/media/File:Merge-sort-example-300px.gif\"\u003esource\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe merge sort conceptually consists of two separate functions: \u003ccode\u003emergeSort\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003emerge\u003c/code\u003e.

The bubble sort is a basic sorting algorithm named after the way elements progressively \u0026ldquo;bubble up\u0026rdquo; to the top of the list.\nsource\nCode Example func bubbleSort(_ array: [Int]) -\u0026gt; [Int] { var A = array var N = array.count var swapping = true while swapping { swapping = false for i in 1 ..\u0026lt; N { if A[i - 1] \u0026gt; A[i] { let tmp = A[i - 1] A[i - 1] = A[i] A[i] = tmp swapping = true } } N -= 1 } return A } Implementation The bubble sort uses an loop and swapping property to control it behaviour. Inside the loop, it iterates over all elements, comparing the current and next elements. If the current element is greater than the next, it swaps them.\nThe example above uses optimized bubble sort, where the inner loop avoids looking at the last n − 1 items when running for the n-th time, resulting in about a 50% improvement in the worst-case scenario.\nTime/Space Complexity Bubble sort has a worst-case and average time complexity of O(n²), where n is the number of items being sorted.\nThe worst-case space complexity is O(n) total, O(1) auxiliary.\nThank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/dsa-sorting-bubble-sort/","summary":"\u003ch3

That implementation has a lot of collisions because we are using a fixed-size array.\nIf we want to reduce the chances of collisions, we can increase the number of slots in the hashmap, or in other words, resize our hashmap. Resizing cannot guarantee that collisions will be entirely eliminated, but it will help reduce the likelihood of one happening.\nCode Example private func loadFactor() -\u0026gt; Double? { if self.hashMap.isEmpty { return nil } else { var filledSlots = 0 for slot in self.hashMap { if slot != nil { filledSlots += 1 } } return Double(filledSlots / self.hashMap.count) } } private func resize() { if self.hashMap.isEmpty { self.hashMap = [nil] return } guard let load = self.loadFactor() else { return } if load \u0026lt; 0.05 { return } let oldHashMap = self.hashMap self.hashMap = Array(repeating: nil, count: oldHashMap.count * 10) for kvp in oldHashMap { if let kvp = kvp { self.insert(key: kvp.key, value: kvp.value) } } } Implementation When resizing, we create a new hashmap with a larger number of slots. Then, we re-insert all the key-value pairs from the old hashmap into the new one.\nThe resize method requires a helper function, load factor, which determines the number of filled buckets as a percentage of the total number of buckets.\nAs for the resize algorithm, it checks if the underlying hashmap is empty. If it is, it creates a new hashmap with a length of 1. It then gets the current load, and if it\u0026rsquo;s more than 5%, it creates a new empty array hashmap with 10x the size of the current one. After that, it uses the insert method to re-insert all key-value pairs from the old hashmap into the new one.\nThe final step is to update the insert method and perform a resize check before inserting to ensure there is enough space.\nComplete Code Example final class HashMap\u0026lt;Key: StringProtocol, Value\u0026gt; { private(set) var hashMap: [(key: Key, value: Value)?] init(size: Int) { self.hashMap = Array(repeating: nil, count: size) } func getValue(by key: Key) -\u0026gt; Value? { let index = hashFunction(key: key) return self.hashMap[index]?.value } func insert(key: Key, value: Value) { self.resize() let index = hashFunction(key: key) self.hashMap[index] = (key, value) } private func hashFunction(key: Key) -\u0026gt; Int { var count = 0 for element in key.unicodeScalars { count += Int(element.value) } return count % self.hashMap.count } private func resize() { if self.hashMap.isEmpty { self.hashMap = [nil] return } guard let load = self.loadFactor() else { return } if load \u0026lt; 0.05 { return } let oldHashMap = self.hashMap self.hashMap = Array(repeating: nil, count: oldHashMap.count * 10) for kvp in oldHashMap { if let kvp = kvp { self.insert(key: kvp.key, value: kvp.value) } } } private func loadFactor() -\u0026gt; Double? { if self.hashMap.isEmpty { return nil } else { var filledSlots = 0 for slot in self.hashMap { if slot != nil { filledSlots += 1 } } return Double(filledSlots / self.hashMap.count) } } } Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/dsa-hashmap-resize/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreviously, we discussed a \u003ca href=\"https://open.substack.com/pub/dmytrosblog/p/dsa-hashmap-custom-implementation?r=2fepxg\u0026amp;utm_campaign=post\u0026amp;utm_medium=web\u0026amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true\"\u003ecustom hashmap implementation\u003c/a\u003e.

val: Value? var left: BSTNode? var right: BSTNode? init(val: Value? = nil) { self.val = val } func exists(_ val: Value) -\u0026gt; Bool { // 1 guard let selfVal = self.val else { return false } // 2

self.right!.exists(val) } } Implementation The exists algorithm:\nCheck if self.val exists. If it does not exist, return false. If it does, move to the next step. Compare self.val with the input value. If the values are equal, return true. If they are not equal, move to the next step. If the input val is less than self.val, and the left node exists, return a recursive call of the exists method on the left node; otherwise, return false. If the input val is greater than self.val, move to the next step. Check if the right node exists. If it does not exist, return false. If it does exist, move to the next step. Return a recursive call of the exists method on the right node. Time/Space Complexity Time complexity: The time complexity of the exists algorithm is O(N), where N is the total number of nodes. Space complexity: O(1) if recursion stack space is not considered. Otherwise, O(H), where H is the height of the tree. In the worst case, H can be the same as N (when the tree is skewed). In the best case, H can be the same as log N (when the tree is complete).

Postorder"},{"content":"What is tree traversal? Tree traversal, also known as \u0026ldquo;tree search\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;walking the tree,\u0026rdquo; is the process of visiting each node in a tree data structure exactly once.\nWhat is the BST preorder algorithm? The preorder algorithm returns a list of values in the order they are visited. It makes a copy that preserves the structure and recursively traverses the BST.\nCode example func preorder(_ visited: inout [Value]) -\u0026gt; [Value] { if self.val != nil { visited.append(self.val!) } if self.left != nil { self.left!.preorder(\u0026amp;visited) } if self.right != nil { self.right!.preorder(\u0026amp;visited) } return visited } Implementation The first step is to check if val exists. If it does, append val to the visited array. The second step is to check if the left node exists. If it does, recursively call the preorder method on the left node. The third step is similar to the second one but for the right node. Time/Space Complexity The time complexity of the preorder algorithm is O(N), where N is the total number of nodes. The space complexity: O(1) if no recursion stack space is considered. Otherwise, O(H), where H is the height of the tree. In the worst case, H can be the same as N (when the tree is skewed). In the best case, H can be the same as logN (when the tree is complete).

If it does not, return nil. If it has a value, move to the second step. The second step is to check if the delete value is less than self.val. If it is, check if the left node exists. If it does not exist, return the self node. If it does exist, call delete on the left node and assign the new result to the left node. The third step is the opposite of the second step but for the right node. The fourth step is to check if the right node is nil. If it is, return the left node. The fifth step is the opposite of the fourth but for the left and right nodes. The sixth step is to find the minLargerNode, update self.val with minLargerNode.val, and delete minLargerNode.val from the right node, assigning the new result to it. Time Complexity The time complexity of the BST deletion algorithm is O(h), where h is the height of the tree.\nIn the case where the BST becomes skewed, the height of the BST h becomes O(n), making the time complexity O(n).\nIn the case where the BST is balanced, the height of the BST h becomes O(log n), making the time complexity O(log n).\nThank you for reading! 😊

A Tree is a data structure that has a root and subtrees of children, representing a set of linked nodes. Trees behave similarly to a LinkedList in that they have a collection of nodes starting with a head (root). The main difference is that Trees can have multiple children, whereas a LinkedList, on the other hand, can have only one next child.\nI’m going to focus on a commonly used type of tree, the Binary Search Tree.\nBinary Search Tree A Binary Search Tree (BST) is also called an ordered tree. A BST has two children, left and right. The left child value is always less than its parent value, and the right child value is always greater than its parent value. Duplicate values are not allowed. These constraints help to add, remove, and find nodes very quickly (on average O(log n), worst case O(n)).\nCode Example final class BSTNode { let val: Int var left: BSTNode? var right: BSTNode? init( val: Int, left: BSTNode? = nil, right: BSTNode? = nil ) { self.val = val self.left = left self.right = right } } BST - Insert Let’s look at how binary search tree insertion works:\nOne of the BST constraints is that duplicate values are not allowed, so we need to check for duplicates before adding any logic. The next step is to check if the inserting value is less than self.val and recursively insert this value into the left child node, or create a new left child node if it does not exist. The final step is to recursively insert the value into the right child if it exists, or create a new node. func insert(_ val: Int) { if self.val == val { return } if val \u0026lt; self.val { if self.left != nil { self.left!.insert(val) return } else { self.left = BSTNode(val: val) return } } if self.right != nil { self.right!.insert(val) return } self.right = BSTNode(val: val) } BST - Delete Let\u0026rsquo;s look at another operation, delete, which is slightly more complicated than insert:\nThe first step is to compare the value the user is trying to delete with self.val. If it is less and the left child exists, then delete the value from left recursively and update left. The second step is the opposite of the previous step but for the right child. The third and fourth steps are base cases, where we need to check if right and left children exist. If the right child does not exist, return the left child, and vice versa for the left child. The final step is to find the minLargerNode, update the value, and replace the right child with this node. func delete(_ val: Int) -\u0026gt; BSTNode? { if val \u0026lt; self.val { if self.left != nil { self.left = self.left!.delete(val) } return self } if val \u0026gt; self.val { if self.right != nil { self.right = self.right!.delete(val) } return self } if self.right == nil { return self.left } if self.left == nil { return self.right } var minLargerNode = self.right while minLargerNode?.left != nil { minLargerNode = minLargerNode!.left } self.val = minLargerNode!.val self.right = self.right?.delete(minLargerNode!.val) return self } Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/dsa-binary-search-tree/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-a-tree\"\u003eWhat is a Tree?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28data_structure%29\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eTree\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is a data structure that has a root and subtrees of children, representing a set of linked nodes. \u003ccode\u003eTrees\u003c/code\u003e behave similarly to a \u003ca href=\"https://dmytrosblog.substack.com/p/dsa-linked-list?r=2fepxg\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eLinkedList\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e in that they have a collection of nodes starting with a \u003ccode\u003ehead (root)\u003c/code\u003e.

A linked list can be used in stacks, queues, and lists.\nCode Example final class ListNode { let val: Int var next: ListNode? init(val: Int, next: ListNode? = nil) { self.val = val self.next = next } } final class LinkedList { private(set) var head: ListNode? init(head: ListNode? = nil) { self.head = head } func addToTail(_ newNode: ListNode?) { if self.head == nil { self.head = newNode return } var node: ListNode? = self.head while node?.next != nil { node = node!.next } node?.next = newNode } func addToHead(_ newNode: ListNode?) { newNode?.next = self.head self.head = newNode } } Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/dsa-linked-list/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-a-linked-list\"\u003eWhat is a Linked List?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list\"\u003elinked list\u003c/a\u003e is a common data structure that is similar to an array, but its order is based on pointers to the next element in memory instead of using physical placement (indices).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA linked list has two main components:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eListNode\u003c/strong\u003e class: This class has a \u003ccode\u003eval\u003c/code\u003e property that represents the value and a \u003ccode\u003enext\u003c/code\u003e property that represents a pointer to the next element in memory.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLinkedList\u003c/strong\u003e class: This class stores a collection of \u003ccode\u003eListNode\u003c/code\u003e elements and provides operations like \u003ccode\u003eadd to tail\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eadd to head\u003c/code\u003e.\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe \u003ccode\u003eadd to tail\u003c/code\u003e operation takes O(n) time because it needs to iterate through the list to find the last element.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe \u003ccode\u003eadd to head\u003c/code\u003e operation takes O(1) time because it only needs to set the next pointer of the new node to the current head and update the head with the new node.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"where-can-it-be-used\"\u003eWhere can it be used?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA linked list can be used in stacks, queues, and lists.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"DSA - Linked List"},{"content":"What is binary search?

The two pointers technique helps track indices in a collection of elements to access objects in memory by index with O(1) space. This technique is very handy when you need to optimize the time and space of a solution.\nWhat Problems Does It Solve? The two pointers technique solves problems involving collections. For example, it is useful when you need to compare each element to other elements in that collection.\nWhat Are the Ways to Use It? The first way to use the two pointers technique is to set the left pointer at the beginning of the array and the right pointer at the end, then increment the left and decrement the right pointer until they meet.\nwhile l \u0026lt; r { l += 1 r -= 1 } The second way is to use slow and fast pointers for cycle detection in a LinkedList. It is called fast and slow because the fast pointer moves twice as fast as the slow pointer.\nclass Node { var val: Int var next: Node? init(val: Int, next: Node? = nil) { self.val = val self.next = next } } func hasCycle(_ head: Node?) -\u0026gt; Bool { var fast = head var slow = head while fast != nil \u0026amp;\u0026amp; fast?.next != nil { fast = fast?.next?.next slow = slow?.next if fast == slow { return true } } return false } Problem As an example, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted problem.\nGiven a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one, as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2. The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice. Your solution must use only constant extra space.\nSolution Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the solution to the Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted problem that uses the two pointers technique, where the left pointer is initialized with the first index in the array and the right pointer is initialized with the last index.\nclass Solution { func twoSum(_ numbers: [Int], _ target: Int) -\u0026gt; [Int] { var l: Int = 0 var r: Int = numbers.count - 1 while l \u0026lt; r { if numbers[l] + numbers[r] \u0026lt; target { l += 1 } else if numbers[l] + numbers[r] \u0026gt; target { r -= 1 } else { return [l+1,r+1] } } return [] } } Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/dsa-two-pointers-technique/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-the-two-pointers-technique\"\u003eWhat is the Two Pointers Technique?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two pointers technique helps track indices in a collection of elements to access objects in memory by index with O(1) space.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order. The final sorted array should not be returned by the function but should instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.\nSolution class Solution { func merge(_ nums1: inout [Int], _ m: Int, _ nums2: [Int], _ n: Int) { if m == 0 { nums1 = nums2 } else if n == 0 { let tmp = nums1 nums1 = tmp } else { var num1result: [Int] = [] for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; m { num1result.append(nums1[i]) } var num2result: [Int] = [] for i in 0 ..\u0026lt; n { num2result.append(nums2[i]) } var result = num1result + num2result result.sort() nums1 = result } } } Approach The brute-force way to solve this problem is to check the lengths of m and n, and if it\u0026rsquo;s 0, assign a copy of nums2 or nums1 appropriately. In case m and n are not equal to 0, create additional arrays and loop through nums1 and nums2, taking into account the number of elements in the m and n properties.\nTime Complexity: O(logn) because it uses the underlying sort method. Space Complexity: O(m+n) because it uses additional arrays for num1 and num2 results. Optimized Approach I found a more optimal solution that uses Time Complexity: O(m + n), Space Complexity: O(1), and a three-pointer technique. In this solution, the i pointer reads values from nums1, the j pointer reads values from nums2, and the w pointer writes values to nums1. Loop backward through the sum of m + n elements and update the nums1 values. Decrement the i pointer if i is greater than or equal to 0 and the value of nums1[i] is greater than nums2[j]. If not, update the value in nums1 and decrement the j pointer.\nclass Solution { func merge(_ nums1: inout [Int], _ m: Int, _ nums2: [Int], _ n: Int) { var i = m - 1 var j = n - 1 for w in stride(from:n+m-1, through:0, by:-1) { if j \u0026lt; 0 { break } if i \u0026gt;= 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; nums1[i] \u0026gt; nums2[j] { nums1[w] = nums1[i] i -= 1 } else { nums1[w] = nums2[j] j -= 1 } } } } Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/dsa-merge-sorted-array-problem/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the \u003ca href=\"https://dmytros.blog/posts/data-structures-and-algorithms-arrays-swift/\"\u003eprevious chapter\u003c/a\u003e, we discussed Data Structures and Algorithms, delved into an overview of Dynamic Arrays, and solved the \u0026ldquo;Remove Element\u0026rdquo; problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, I\u0026rsquo;m going to show one of the ways to solve the \u003ca href=\"https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/?envType=study-plan-v2\u0026amp;envId=top-interview-150\"\u003e88.

A data structure is a collection of data values and the relationships among them.\nAlgorithm An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that helps solve a specific problem. A real-world example could be a cooking recipe or the steps to prepare coffee with a coffee machine.\nArrays In the Swift programming language, arrays are dynamic by default. A dynamic array is a commonly used data structure that consists of a collection of elements of the same memory size, with each element identified by an index or key. You can access, remove, and add new elements to the tail by index in O(1) time.\nTime Complexity Peak Index Insert or Delete from Beginning Insert or Delete from End Insert or Delete from Middle O(1) O(n) O(1) O(n) Resizing a Dynamic Array A dynamic array increases its underlying capacity and resizes to double its size only when the array size equals its capacity, to avoid the expensive cost of resizing frequently.\nProblem 27. Remove Element. Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val. Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:\nChange the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums. Return k. Solution class Solution { func removeElement(_ nums: inout [Int], _ val: Int) -\u0026gt; Int { var i = 0 while i \u0026lt; nums.count { if nums[i] == val { nums.remove(at: i) } else { i += 1 } } return nums.count } } Approach to Solving Problems One brute-force way to solve this problem is to loop through all values and check if a number is equal to a value. If it is, then remove the element with this index from the array; if not, increment the index.\nTime Complexity: O(n) because the value can be at the end of the array, requiring a loop through all values.\nSpace Complexity: O(1) because no additional space is required; all occurrences of the value are removed in-place.\nResources I’m very grateful for the NeetCode roadmap and in-depth algorithm explanations. I’ve learned a lot about new techniques and ways to solve problems more efficiently.

I decided to look into it and share what I found. In this article, I will focus on the steps to integrate HealthKit, write, and access its data.\nPreparation Before we dive into implementation, I assume that you have an active Apple Developer account; without it, you will not be able to access the HealthKit Store. Let’s add:\nHealthKit Capability to the project Privacy permission Privacy – Health Share Usage Description, Privacy – Health Update Usage Description keys to Info.plist. Implementation First Step The first step is to call the isHealthDataAvailable method and make sure that it is available.\nguard HKHealthStore.isHealthDataAvailable() else { throw HealthkitSetupError.notAvailableOnDevice } Data Type Preparation Next, you need to prepare the data types that you will be reading and writing from the HealthKit central repository.\nguard let height = HKObjectType.quantityType(forIdentifier: .height), let bodyMass = HKObjectType.quantityType(forIdentifier: .bodyMass), let activeEnergyBurned = HKObjectType.quantityType(forIdentifier: .activeEnergyBurned) else { throw HealthkitSetupError.dataTypeNotAvailable } let typesToWrite: Set\u0026lt;HKSampleType\u0026gt; = [height, bodyMass, HKObjectType.workoutType()] let typesToRead: Set\u0026lt;HKObjectType\u0026gt; = [height, bodyMass, activeEnergyBurned, HKObjectType.workoutType()] Request Authorization Next, you need to request authorization with the data types that you defined above.\ntry await HKHealthStore().requestAuthorization(toShare: typesToWrite, read: typesToRead) import Inject import SwiftUI public struct ContentView: View { @ObserveInjection var inject @State var healthKitService: HealthKitService = .init() public init() {} public var body: some View { VStack {}.onAppear { Task { do { try await healthKitService.requestAuthorization() print(\u0026#34;HealthKit authorization request success\u0026#34;) } catch { print(\u0026#34;HealthKit authorization request failed error: \\(error)\u0026#34;) } } } .enableInjection() } } Reading/Saving Data Reading Data When you need to read/save data using HealthKit, you can do it by applying the HKHealthStore object.\n\u0026#x1f4a1; HKHealthStore - The access point for all data managed by HealthKit.\nAs an example, you can read characteristic data by utilizing HKHealthStore-defined methods such as biologicalSex, bloodType, dateOfBirthComponents, etc.\nfunc getProfileData() throws -\u0026gt; ProfileData { let healthStore = HKHealthStore() let dateOfBirthComponents = try healthStore.dateOfBirthComponents() let today = Date() let calendar = Calendar.current let todayDateComponents = calendar.dateComponents([.year], from: today) let thisYear = todayDateComponents.year! let age = thisYear - dateOfBirthComponents.year! let biologicalSex = try healthStore.biologicalSex() let bloodType = try healthStore.bloodType() let profileData = ProfileData(age: age, biologicalSex: biologicalSex.biologicalSex, bloodType: bloodType.bloodType) return profileData } struct ProfileData { var age: Int?

I\u0026rsquo;ve always wondered how gRPC operates. In this article, I will explore what gRPC is, how to install and use it, and when to use gRPC.\nWhat is gRPC? gRPC is an open-source, high-performance framework that facilitates efficient communication in distributed systems. gRPC is an implementation of the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol, which enables services to call functions on other machines as if they were local software methods. gRPC was developed by Google in 2015, and it includes several features that enhance the way remote procedure calls are made. For instance, its use of Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) supports strongly typed service contracts, data serialization, and code generation in a variety of programming languages. It also uses HTTP/2 as its transport protocol, which facilitates bi-directional streaming and reduces latency.\nInstallation Process Prerequisites Swift Version gRPC requires Swift 5.8 or higher.\nInstall Protocol Buffers Install the protoc compiler that is used to generate gRPC service code. The simplest way to do this is to download pre-compiled binaries for your platform (protoc-\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;platform\u0026gt;.zip) from here: https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases.\nUnzip this file. Update the environment variable PATH to include the path to the protoc binary file. Download the Example You\u0026rsquo;ll need a local copy of the example code to work through this quickstart. Download the example code from our GitHub repository (the following command clones the entire repository, but you just need the examples for this quickstart and other tutorials):\n# Clone the repository at the latest release to get the example code (replacing x.y.z with the latest release, for example 1.13.0): git clone -b x.y.z https://github.com/grpc/grpc-swift # Navigate to the repository cd grpc-swift/ Implementation Process Run a gRPC Application From the grpc-swift directory:\nCompile and run the server:\nswift run HelloWorldServer In another terminal, compile and run the client:\nswift run HelloWorldClient Greeter received: Hello stranger! Congratulations! You\u0026rsquo;ve just run a client-server application with gRPC.\nUpdate a gRPC Service Now let\u0026rsquo;s look at how to update the application with an extra method on the server for the client to call. Our gRPC service is defined using protocol buffers; you can find out lots more about how to define a service in a .proto file in What is gRPC?. For now, all you need to know is that both the server and the client \u0026ldquo;stub\u0026rdquo; have a SayHello RPC method that takes a HelloRequest parameter from the client and returns a HelloReply from the server, and that this method is defined like this:\n// The greeting service definition. service Greeter { // Sends a greeting. rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {} } // The request message containing the user\u0026#39;s name. message HelloRequest { string name = 1; } // The response message containing the greetings. message HelloReply { string message = 1; } Let\u0026rsquo;s update this so that the Greeter service has two methods. Edit Protos/upstream/grpc/examples/helloworld.proto and update it with a new SayHelloAgain method, with the same request and response types:\n// The greeting service definition. service Greeter { // Sends a greeting. rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {} // Sends another greeting. rpc SayHelloAgain (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {} } // The request message containing the user\u0026#39;s name. message HelloRequest { string name = 1; } // The response message containing the greetings. message HelloReply { string message = 1; } (Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to save the file!)\nUpdate and Run the Application We need to regenerate Sources/Examples/v1/HelloWorld/Model/helloworld.grpc.swift, which contains our generated gRPC client and server classes. From the grpc-swift directory run:\nProtos/generate.sh This also regenerates classes for populating, serializing, and retrieving our request and response types. However, we still need to implement and call the new method in the human-written parts of our example application.\nUpdate the Server In the same directory, open Sources/Examples/v1/HelloWorld/Server/GreeterProvider.swift. Implement the new method like this:\nfinal class GreeterProvider: Helloworld_GreeterAsyncProvider { let interceptors: Helloworld_GreeterServerInterceptorFactoryProtocol? = nil func sayHello( request: Helloworld_HelloRequest, context: GRPCAsyncServerCallContext ) async throws -\u0026gt; Helloworld_HelloReply { let recipient = request.name.isEmpty ? \u0026#34;stranger\u0026#34; : request.name return Helloworld_HelloReply.with { $0.message = \u0026#34;Hello \\(recipient)!\u0026#34; } } func sayHelloAgain( request: Helloworld_HelloRequest, context: GRPCAsyncServerCallContext ) async throws -\u0026gt; Helloworld_HelloReply { let recipient = request.name.isEmpty ? \u0026#34;stranger\u0026#34; : request.name return Helloworld_HelloReply.with { $0.message = \u0026#34;Hello again \\(recipient)!\u0026#34; } } } Update the Client In the same directory, open Sources/Examples/v1/HelloWorld/Client/HelloWorldClient.swift. Call the new method like this:\nfunc run() async throws { // Setup an `EventLoopGroup` for the connection to run on. // // See: https://github.com/apple/swift-nio#eventloops-and-eventloopgroups let group = MultiThreadedEventLoopGroup(numberOfThreads: 1) // Make sure the group is shutdown when we\u0026#39;re done with it. defer { try! group.syncShutdownGracefully() } // Configure the channel, we\u0026#39;re not using TLS so the connection is `insecure`. let channel = try GRPCChannelPool.with( target: .host(\u0026#34;localhost\u0026#34;, port: self.port), transportSecurity: .plaintext, eventLoopGroup: group ) // Close the connection when we\u0026#39;re done with it. defer { try! channel.close().wait() } // Provide the connection to the generated client. let greeter = Helloworld_GreeterAsyncClient(channel: channel) // Form the request with the name, if one was provided. let request = Helloworld_HelloRequest.with { $0.name = self.name ?? \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } do { let greeting = try await greeter.sayHello(request) print(\u0026#34;Greeter received: \\(greeting.message)\u0026#34;) } catch { print(\u0026#34;Greeter failed: \\(error)\u0026#34;) } do { let greetingAgain = try await greeter.sayHelloAgain(request) print(\u0026#34;Greeter received: \\(greetingAgain.message)\u0026#34;) } catch { print(\u0026#34;Greeter failed: \\(error)\u0026#34;) } } Run! Just like we did before, from the top-level grpc-swift directory:\nCompile and run the server:\nswift run HelloWorldServer In another terminal, compile and run the client:\nswift run HelloWorldClient Greeter received: Hello stranger! Greeter received: Hello again stranger! When to Use gRPC gRPC was designed to support highly efficient, language-agnostic communication in distributed systems. It is therefore better suited than REST for microservice-based architectures, in which individual services may be developed in different programming languages and may face varying workloads. Additionally, gRPC’s use of Protobuf for binary data serialization makes it the better choice for applications that demand low latency and high throughput, while its support for different streaming patterns makes it ideal for real-time chat and video applications.\nResources gRPC vs. REST gRPC Swift Quick Start Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/implementing-grpc-swift/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve never had the chance to use this technology before.

In this article, I will focus on the first scenario and will show how to scan for peripheral devices.\nFirst Step The first step is to add permission for Bluetooth: Privacy - Bluetooth Always Usage Description Second Step The second step is to initialize centralManager:\nprivate var centralManager: CBCentralManager! override init() { super.init() centralManager = CBCentralManager(delegate: self, queue: nil, options: [CBCentralManagerOptionShowPowerAlertKey: true]) } CBCentralManager - CBCentralManager objects manage discovered or connected remote peripheral devices (represented by CBPeripheral objects), including scanning for, discovering, and connecting to advertising peripherals.\nCBCentralManagerDelegate - The single required centralManagerDidUpdateState method indicates the availability of the central manager, while the optional methods allow for the discovery and connection of peripherals.\nCBCentralManagerOptionShowPowerAlertKey - An NSNumber (Boolean) indicating that the system should, if Bluetooth is powered off when CBCentralManager is instantiated, display a warning dialog to the user.\nThird Step The third step is to scanForPeripherals after centralManager changes its state to poweredOn.\nfunc centralManagerDidUpdateState(_ central: CBCentralManager) { switch central.state { case .poweredOn: print(\u0026#34;CBManager is powered on\u0026#34;) centralManager.scanForPeripherals(withServices: nil) case .poweredOff: print(\u0026#34;CBManager is not powered on\u0026#34;) return case .resetting: print(\u0026#34;CBManager is resetting\u0026#34;) return case .unauthorized: print(\u0026#34;CBManager is unauthorized\u0026#34;) return case .unknown: print(\u0026#34;CBManager state is unknown\u0026#34;) return case .unsupported: print(\u0026#34;Bluetooth is not supported on this device\u0026#34;) return @unknown default: print(\u0026#34;A previously unknown central manager state occurred\u0026#34;) return } } Fourth Step The fourth step is to implement the didDiscover method that is called when the central manager discovers a peripheral.\nfunc centralManager(_ central: CBCentralManager, didDiscover peripheral: CBPeripheral, advertisementData: [String : Any], rssi RSSI: NSNumber) { // Reject if the signal strength is too low. // Change the minimum RSSI value depending on your app’s use case. guard RSSI.intValue \u0026gt;= -50 else { print(\u0026#34;Discovered peripheral not in expected range, at \\(RSSI.intValue)\u0026#34;) return } print(\u0026#34;Discovered \\(String(describing: peripheral.name)) at \\(RSSI.intValue)\u0026#34;) } The sample implementation of this method uses the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) parameter to determine whether the signal is strong enough.

SKEmitterNode Initialization of SKEmitterNode(fileNamed: \u0026quot;Starfield\u0026quot;) helps create a starfield background.\nSKEmitterNode is a node that automatically creates and renders small particle sprites. Particles are privately owned by SpriteKit—your game cannot access the generated sprites. For example, you cannot add physics shapes to particles. Emitter nodes are often used to create smoke, fire, sparks, and other particle effects.\nadvanceSimulationTime advanceSimulationTime(10) - Advances the emitter particle simulation. In other words, you do not need to wait until the particles reach the bottom of the screen. addChild self.addChild(starfield) - Adds a node to the end of the receiver’s list of child nodes. After that, you will be able to see the starfield background.\nzPosition zPosition = -1 - Moves the starfield to the back of the screen.\nResources Enormous appreciation for Brian Advent for his comprehensive video.

This resulted in optimization problems and inefficient consumption of OS resources.\nThe codebase contained closures and async/await, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t possible to use operators like merge or combineLatest. After discovering this limitation, I decided to add new methods using Combine.\nI will be demonstrating this with a simple NetworkService responsible only for executing and validating requests using Combine. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive into the implementation.\nFirst Step The first step is to create the NetworkService with request(_ endpoint: Endpoint) method.\nfunc request\u0026lt;T: Decodable\u0026gt;(_ endpoint: Endpoint) -\u0026gt; AnyPublisher\u0026lt;T, Error\u0026gt; {} Quick Explanation of What AnyPublisher Is The AnyPublisher returns a publisher from a method without exposing the specific type of publisher you are using internally. It helps hide implementation details.\nSecond Step The second step is to add a few helpers such as Endpoint and NetworkError.\nstruct Endpoint { let url: String let headers: [String: String]? let body: Data? let httpMethod: HTTPMethod func urlRequest(with url: URL) -\u0026gt; URLRequest { var urlRequest = URLRequest(url: url) urlRequest.httpMethod = httpMethod.rawValue urlRequest.allHTTPHeaderFields = headers ??

It worked for me and my teammates, but I knew it could be better. It looks something like this:\nTesting Using an APNS File To test push notifications using an APNS file, you need to create a file with a .apns extension and put JSON into it.\n{ \u0026#34;Simulator Target Bundle\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dev.mt.Demo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;aps\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;alert\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Title\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;body\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Body\u0026#34; } } } You also need to specify the Simulator Target Bundle; without it, you will receive an error. After that, you can drag this file to the simulator. When I found the RocketSim app and learned about its ability to send push notifications from the simulator side menu, it was a game changer for me. No more dragging files or terminal commands—it’s all in one place. The only thing you need to do is create the payload.\nTesting Using the RocketSim App To test push notifications using the RocketSim app, all you need to do is:\nOpen the RocketSim app. Go to the simulator side menu. Click on the bell button. Click on the “Configure Push Notifications” button. The last step is to add groups, set the bundle identifier, switch to push notifications, and add a push notification. Now you have configured the push notification, and from now on, you can send it with just a tap in the RocketSim app\u0026rsquo;s simulator side menu. Summary Using the RocketSim app saved me a lot of time and effort. Without it, I would still be testing manually and spending time on work that could be automated.

Here is what I found:\nQuick Overview NSCache helps store data in memory. When the application gets killed, it frees memory; it’s not persisted on disk. Storing data is carried out using a key-value pair mechanism like Dictionary. You can set automatic eviction to delete objects automatically. NSCache has multi-platform support: iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, macOS, and tvOS. Caveats NSCache has Objective-C roots. It can’t use struct because it is constrained to conform to AnyObject, meaning you must use class and NSString instead of String.\nStore Object You can store an object by setting it in the cache:\nfunc storeImage(_ image: UIImage, for key: String) { cache.setObject(image, forKey: key as NSString) } Retrieve Object You can retrieve an object by getting the object for the key:\nfunc retrieveImage(for key: String) -\u0026gt; UIImage? { cache.object(forKey: key as NSString) } Removing Object You can remove an object by removing the object for the key, or remove all objects:\nfunc removeImage(for key: String) { cache.removeObject(forKey: key as NSString) } func removeAllImages() { cache.removeAllObjects() } Automatically Cache Cleaning You can limit the number of objects in memory by setting countLimit. countLimit depends on the size of the object that you need to store in the cache. If it’s a large image, the limit can be less.\ncache.countLimit = 5 Another way to do automatic cleaning is to set up totalCostLimit. NSCache will automatically delete objects until the total cost of the cache is under the totalCostLimit.\ncache.totalCostLimit = 10 * 1024 * 1024 // 10 MB Caveats Even if you don’t set any deletion conditions, NSCache will automatically clean up when the system really needs memory.\nNSCacheDelegate cache(_:willEvictObject:) notifies when an object is being removed. It helps in cases when you need to react to these changes.\nextension CacheService: NSCacheDelegate { func cache(_ cache: NSCache\u0026lt;AnyObject, AnyObject\u0026gt;, willEvictObject obj: Any) { print(\u0026#34;Object will be evicted: \\(obj)\u0026#34;) } } Complete Sample final class CacheService: NSObject { private let cache: NSCache\u0026lt;NSString, UIImage\u0026gt; override init() { cache = NSCache() cache.name = \u0026#34;Remote Image Cache\u0026#34; cache.countLimit = 5 cache.totalCostLimit = 10 * 1024 * 1024 // 10 MB } func storeImage(_ image: UIImage, for key: String) { cache.setObject(image, forKey: key as NSString) } func retrieveImage(for key: String) -\u0026gt; UIImage? { cache.object(forKey: key as NSString) } func removeImage(for key: String) { cache.removeObject(forKey: key as NSString) } func removeAllImages() { cache.removeAllObjects() } } // MARK: - NSCacheDelegate extension CacheService: NSCacheDelegate { func cache(_ cache: NSCache\u0026lt;AnyObject, AnyObject\u0026gt;, willEvictObject obj: Any) { print(\u0026#34;Object will be evicted: \\(obj)\u0026#34;) } } Resources Thanks to Andy Ibanez for his amazing straightforward explanation with examples.

You can look at popular applications like YouTube or Netflix; they all have accessibility features like VoiceOver and dynamic fonts. I decided to create this example for a fruit calorie counter. It contains a list of fruits with the fruit name, fruit calories, and a favorite button.\nWhere to Start Before diving into implementation details, I want to highlight some information about the existing accessibility features and what I will be focusing on.\nExisting Accessibility Features Apple provides a variety of tools; here are the most important ones:\nVoiceOver: A screen reader that allows visually impaired users to interact with their devices. Dynamic Type: Support for adjustable text sizes. Users can choose larger text sizes in the system settings, and apps should respond appropriately by scaling text and UI elements. Contrast and Color: Ensuring sufficient contrast between text and background to make content readable for users with visual impairments. Switch Control: A feature that allows users with limited mobility to control their device using adaptive accessories. AssistiveTouch: A feature that helps users with physical disabilities perform actions that would otherwise require gestures. Labels and Hints: Using accessibility labels and hints to provide descriptive text for UI elements, which helps VoiceOver users understand what an element does. Focus Areas I will be focusing on Labels and Hints, VoiceOver, and Dynamic Type.\nImplementation First Step The first step would be to mark yourUIElement.isAccessibilityElement = true to enable your component\u0026rsquo;s visibility for VoiceOver.\nSecond Step The second step would be to define accessibilityElements for UI components that you want to access for VoiceOver. VoiceOver will read elements from top to bottom.\noverride var accessibilityElements: [Any]? { get { return [ nameLabel as Any, caloriesLabel as Any, favouriteButton as Any ] } set { } } Third Step The third step would be to add an accessibilityLabel; it will help identify the control or view.\nfavouriteButton.accessibilityLabel = \u0026#34;favourite\u0026#34; Fourth Step The fourth step would be to add an accessibilityHint; it describes the result of performing an action on the element.\nfavouriteButton.accessibilityHint = favouriteButton.isSelected ? \u0026#34;makes favourite\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;removes favourite\u0026#34; Adding Dynamic Type to Font Size If you run your application and go to the Accessibility Inspector and Run Audit for it, you will probably see an error like Dynamic font sizes are unsupported. This means if you go and change the Text Size for your entire system, your application\u0026rsquo;s font size will not change.\nTo fix it, you need to add adjustsFontForContentSizeCategory = true - it indicates whether the corresponding element should automatically update its font when the device’s UIContentSizeCategory is changed.\nnameLabel.adjustsFontForContentSizeCategory = true caloriesLabel.adjustsFontForContentSizeCategory = true If you need a custom font in your application, you need to transform the custom font to Dynamic Type by using UIFontMetrics.default.scaledFont.\nNow you can actually test it from the Accessibility Inspector settings page.\nCaveats The last thing is to make the table view automatically calculate row size because your content can potentially be clipped, as it happened to me 😊 You just need to add UITableView.automaticDimension to the heightForRowAt method of UITableViewDelegate.\nDownload Materials Download\nThank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/accessibility-ios-uikit/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was curious to find out how to make an application more accessible.

I was excited to learn when to apply this technology, what tools I can use, and how I can implement it. Here’s what I found:\nFor testing, I used the Star Wars GraphQL API with AllFilmsQuery:\nquery AllFilmsQuery { allFilms { films { title director created producers releaseDate } } } I requested allFilms with title, director, created, producers, and releaseDate information.\nWhen to Apply This Technology The best way to use GraphQL is when you have multiple platform applications such as web, mobile, and TV, and each client needs to request the specific data they require. It\u0026rsquo;s also beneficial when you need to fetch complex, nested, or related data from multiple sources. What Tools to Use GraphiQL Live Demo - A graphical interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE. Apollo iOS Docs - Apollo iOS is an open-source GraphQL client for native client applications, written in Swift. Apollo iOS Code Generation CLI - A CLI to generate boilerplate code. Caveats Before diving into implementation, I would like to highlight a few nuances.\nYou need to add NetworkInterceptorProvider and AuthorizationInterceptor to authenticate your operations. Without them, you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to access the data on your server.\nHow to Implement It Client class NetworkInterceptorProvider: DefaultInterceptorProvider { override func interceptors\u0026lt;Operation\u0026gt;(for operation: Operation) -\u0026gt; [ApolloInterceptor] where Operation : GraphQLOperation { var interceptors = super.interceptors(for: operation) interceptors.insert(AuthorizationInterceptor(), at: 0) return interceptors } } class AuthorizationInterceptor: ApolloInterceptor { let id: String = UUID().uuidString func interceptAsync\u0026lt;Operation\u0026gt;( chain: RequestChain, request: HTTPRequest\u0026lt;Operation\u0026gt;, response: HTTPResponse\u0026lt;Operation\u0026gt;?, completion: @escaping (Result\u0026lt;GraphQLResult\u0026lt;Operation.Data\u0026gt;, Error\u0026gt;) -\u0026gt; Void ) where Operation : GraphQLOperation { chain.proceedAsync(request: request, response: response, completion: completion) } } private let apollo: ApolloClient = { let client = URLSessionClient() let cache = InMemoryNormalizedCache() let store = ApolloStore(cache: cache) let provider = NetworkInterceptorProvider(client: client, store: store) let url = URL(string: \u0026#34;https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/index\u0026#34;)! let transport = RequestChainNetworkTransport(interceptorProvider: provider, endpointURL: url) return ApolloClient(networkTransport: transport, store: store) }() UI import SwiftUI import Apollo import StarWarsAPI struct ContentView: View { @State private var list: [AllFilmsQuery.Data.AllFilms.Film?] = [] var body: some View { VStack { ForEach(list, id: \\.self) { row in Text(row?.title ?? \u0026#34;\u0026#34;) } }.onAppear(perform: { apollo.fetch(query: AllFilmsQuery()) { result in switch result { case .success(let response): self.list = response.data?.allFilms?.films ??

It wasn\u0026rsquo;t easy because most articles on the Internet discussed general implementations, such as for a coffee shop or a to-do list. Even when I found some similar versions, the project wouldn\u0026rsquo;t compile. I made the decision to approach it my way, so here\u0026rsquo;s what I found out:\nCaveats After being stuck for two or more hours without understanding why, after tapping on a button, I wasn't able to receive a callback from it and the widget always opened the main iOS app, I realized that I forgot to add AppIntent - without it, you can\u0026rsquo;t handle actions for iOS 17. import AppIntents struct ButtonIntent: AppIntent { static let title: LocalizedStringResource = \u0026#34;ButtonIntent\u0026#34; @Parameter(title: \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;) var id: String func perform() async throws -\u0026gt; some IntentResult { if id == Command.playPause.rawValue { DataModel.shared.isPlaying.toggle() } return .result() } } Another crucial point is not to forget to add an explicit init. If you don\u0026rsquo;t implement it explicitly, it will not work. import AppIntents struct ButtonIntent: AppIntent { static let title: LocalizedStringResource = \u0026#34;ButtonIntent\u0026#34; @Parameter(title: \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;) var id: String init(id: String) { self.id = id } init() {} func perform() async throws -\u0026gt; some IntentResult { if id == Command.playPause.rawValue { DataModel.shared.isPlaying.toggle() } return .result() } } Lastly, I attempted to add a Slider, but I found that it\u0026rsquo;s not supported by the widget. My solution was to choose a ProgressView instead. Implementation struct YouTubeLockScreenWidget: View { var body: some View { VStack { Spacer() ProgressView(value: DataModel.shared.currentTime, total: DataModel.shared.totalTime) .progressViewStyle(.linear) Spacer() HStack { ForEach(Command.allCases) { command in Button(intent: ButtonIntent(id: command.id)) { Image(systemName: imageSystemName(isPlaying: DataModel.shared.isPlaying, command: command)) } } } } } } final class DataModel { static let shared = DataModel() var isPlaying: Bool = false var currentTime: TimeInterval = 34 var totalTime: TimeInterval = 304 } enum Command: String, CaseIterable { case previous case playPause case next } extension Command: Identifiable { var id: String { rawValue } } func imageSystemName(isPlaying: Bool, command: Command) -\u0026gt; String { switch command { case .playPause: if isPlaying { return \u0026#34;pause.fill\u0026#34; } else { return \u0026#34;play.fill\u0026#34; } case .next: return \u0026#34;forward.fill\u0026#34; case .previous: return \u0026#34;backward.fill\u0026#34; } } I had not replaced default generated code when I was adding widget to the project. I just added YouTubeLockScreenWidget to generated VideoStreamingWidgetEntryView.\nstruct VideoStreamingWidgetEntryView : View { var entry: Provider.Entry var body: some View { YouTubeLockScreenWidget() } } Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/building-video-streaming-widget-for-ios-app/","summary":"\u003ch3

Here\u0026rsquo;s what I discovered:\nTo be able to send and receive messages, you need to create an interface for communication between a server and your application. In my case, I chose sendMessage and receiveMessage methods. For the server-side, I chose Node.js. For the iOS application, I chose the Socket.IO library. Implementation Let’s dive deeper into the implementation.\nFirst step The first step would be to create a server.js file to be able to handle incoming events.\nconst express = require(\u0026#39;express\u0026#39;); const app = express(); const server = require(\u0026#39;http\u0026#39;).Server(app); const io = require(\u0026#39;socket.io\u0026#39;)(server); const { randomUUID } = require(\u0026#39;crypto\u0026#39;); const users = new Map(); io.on(\u0026#39;connection\u0026#39;, (socket) =\u0026gt; { let username = socket.handshake.auth.username; console.log(\u0026#39;a user connected\u0026#39;); users.set(socket.id, username); io.emit(\u0026#39;receiveNewUser\u0026#39;, username, Object.fromEntries(users)); socket.on(\u0026#39;sendMessage\u0026#39;, (message) =\u0026gt; { const username = users.get(socket.id); io.emit(\u0026#39;receiveMessage\u0026#39;, randomUUID(), username, message); }); socket.on(\u0026#39;disconnect\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#39;user disconnected\u0026#39;); users.delete(socket.id); }); }); server.listen(3000, () =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#39;listening on *:3000\u0026#39;); }); Second step The next step would be creating a ChatService that will be responsible for connect, disconnect, send, and receive data.\nimport SocketIO final class ChatService { private var manager: SocketManager! private var socket: SocketIOClient! private var username: String! init() { manager = SocketManager(socketURL: URL(string: \u0026#34;http://localhost:3000\u0026#34;)!) socket = manager.defaultSocket } func connect(username: String) { self.username = username socket.connect(withPayload: [\u0026#34;username\u0026#34;: username]) } func disconnect() { socket.disconnect() } func sendMessage(_ message: String) { socket.emit(\u0026#34;sendMessage\u0026#34;, message) } func sendUsername(_ username: String) { socket.emit(\u0026#34;sendUsername\u0026#34;, username) } func receiveMessage(_ completion: @escaping (String, String, UUID) -\u0026gt; Void) { socket.on(\u0026#34;receiveMessage\u0026#34;) { data, _ in if let text = data[2] as?

String, let users = data[1] as? [String:String] { completion(username, users) } } } } Third step The next step would be creating a ViewModel communicating with the ChatService.\nimport Foundation final class ViewModel: ObservableObject { private let chatService: ChatService = ChatService() @Published var message: String = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; @Published var messages: [Message] = [] @Published var username: String = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; @Published var users: [String:String] = [:] @Published var newUser: String = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; @Published var showUsernamePrompt: Bool = true @Published var isShowingNewUserAlert = false } extension ViewModel { func connect() { chatService.connect(username: username) chatService.receiveMessage { username, text, id in self.receiveMessage(username: username, text: text, id: id) } chatService.receiveNewUser { username, users in self.receiveNewUser(username: username, users: users) } showUsernamePrompt = false } func sendMessage() { chatService.sendMessage(message) message = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } func receiveMessage(username: String, text: String, id: UUID) { messages.append(Message(username: username, text: text, id: id)) } func receiveNewUser(username: String, users: [String:String]) { self.users = users self.newUser = username self.isShowingNewUserAlert = self.username != username } func disconnect() { chatService.disconnect() message = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; messages = [] username = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; users = [:] newUser = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; showUsernamePrompt = true isShowingNewUserAlert = false } } Fourth step The last step would be creating UI and connecting it with the ViewModel.\nimport SwiftUI struct ChatView: View { @StateObject private var viewModel = ViewModel() var body: some View { NavigationView { VStack { if viewModel.showUsernamePrompt { HStack { TextField(\u0026#34;Enter your username\u0026#34;, text: $viewModel.username) .textFieldStyle(RoundedBorderTextFieldStyle()) Button(action: viewModel.connect) { Text(\u0026#34;Connect\u0026#34;) } } .padding() } else { List { ForEach(viewModel.messages, id: \\.self) { message in HStack { if message.username == viewModel.username { Text(\u0026#34;Me:\u0026#34;) .font(.subheadline) .foregroundColor(.blue) } else { Text(\u0026#34;\\(message.username):\u0026#34;) .font(.subheadline) .foregroundColor(.green) } Text(message.text) } } } HStack { TextField(\u0026#34;Enter a message\u0026#34;, text: $viewModel.message) .textFieldStyle(RoundedBorderTextFieldStyle()) HStack { Button(action: viewModel.sendMessage) { Text(\u0026#34;Send\u0026#34;) } Button(action: viewModel.disconnect) { Text(\u0026#34;Disconnect\u0026#34;) } } } .padding() } } .navigationBarTitle(\u0026#34;Group Chat \\(viewModel.users.count \u0026gt; 0 ? \u0026#34;(\\(viewModel.users.count) connected)\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;\u0026#34;)\u0026#34;) .navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline) .alert(\u0026#34;\\(viewModel.newUser) just joined the chat!\u0026#34;, isPresented: $viewModel.isShowingNewUserAlert) { Button(\u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;, role: .cancel) { viewModel.isShowingNewUserAlert = false } } } } } #Preview { ChatView() } Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/building-group-chat-using-websockets/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never had a chance to work with WebSockets, so I decided to take a look and create a group chat.

As an example, I chose the following parameters to create more realistic recommendations: director, actors, language, country, metascore, IMDb rating, and IMDb votes.\nstruct Movie: Decodable { var id: String { return imdbid } let title: String let keywords: [String] let director: String let actors: String let language: String let country: String let poster: String let metascore: String let imdbrating: String let imdbvotes: String let imdbid: String } extension Movie: Identifiable, TextImageProviding { var url: URL { return URL(string: poster)! } } When you have created the model, you can proceed to the next step:\nCreating a Recommendations service In this step, it\u0026rsquo;s important to specify the ML model you\u0026rsquo;ll utilize. I chose the MLLinearRegressor model because linear regression computes an output value for a given input value. I selected \u0026lsquo;favorite\u0026rsquo; as the target column for this model to create predictions based on the films I like.\nimport Foundation import TabularData #if canImport(CreateML) import CreateML #endif final class RecommendationService { private let queue = DispatchQueue(label: \u0026#34;com.recommendation-service.queue\u0026#34;, qos: .userInitiated) func computeRecommendations(basedOn items: [FavoriteWrapper\u0026lt;Movie\u0026gt;]) async throws -\u0026gt; [Movie] { return try await withCheckedThrowingContinuation { continuation in queue.async { #if targetEnvironment(simulator) continuation.resume(throwing: NSError(domain: \u0026#34;Simulator Not Supported\u0026#34;, code: -1)) #else let trainingData = items.filter { $0.isFavorite != nil } let trainingDataFrame = self.dataFrame(for: trainingData) let testData = items let testDataFrame = self.dataFrame(for: testData) do { let regressor = try MLLinearRegressor(trainingData: trainingDataFrame, targetColumn: \u0026#34;favorite\u0026#34;) let predictionsColumn = (try regressor.predictions(from: testDataFrame)).compactMap { value in value as? Double } let sorted = zip(testData, predictionsColumn) .sorted { lhs, rhs -\u0026gt; Bool in lhs.1 \u0026gt; rhs.1 } .filter { $0.1 \u0026gt; 0 } .prefix(10) print(sorted.map(\\.1)) let result = sorted.map(\\.0.model) continuation.resume(returning: result) } catch { continuation.resume(throwing: error) } #endif } } } private func dataFrame(for data: [FavoriteWrapper\u0026lt;Movie\u0026gt;]) -\u0026gt; DataFrame { var dataFrame = DataFrame() dataFrame.append( column: Column(name: \u0026#34;keywords\u0026#34;, contents: data.flatMap(\\.model.keywords).joined(separator: \u0026#34;, \u0026#34;)) ) dataFrame.append( column: Column(name: \u0026#34;director\u0026#34;, contents: data.map(\\.model.director)) ) dataFrame.append( column: Column(name: \u0026#34;actors\u0026#34;, contents: data.map(\\.model.actors)) ) dataFrame.append( column: Column(name: \u0026#34;language\u0026#34;, contents: data.map(\\.model.language)) ) dataFrame.append( column: Column(name: \u0026#34;country\u0026#34;, contents: data.map(\\.model.country)) ) dataFrame.append( column: Column\u0026lt;Int\u0026gt;( name: \u0026#34;metascore\u0026#34;, contents: data.map { return Int($0.model.metascore) } ) ) dataFrame.append( column: Column\u0026lt;Double\u0026gt;( name: \u0026#34;imdbrating\u0026#34;, contents: data.map { return Double($0.model.imdbrating) } ) ) dataFrame.append( column: Column(name: \u0026#34;imdbvotes\u0026#34;, contents: data.map(\\.model.imdbvotes)) ) dataFrame.append( column: Column\u0026lt;Int\u0026gt;( name: \u0026#34;favorite\u0026#34;, contents: data.map { if let isFavorite = $0.isFavorite { return isFavorite ? 1 : -1 } else { return 0 } } ) ) return dataFrame } } Once you\u0026rsquo;ve finished with the ML part, proceed to the next step:\nCreating a ViewModel to assemble all components At this stage, you handle user input and recompute recommendations based on user input.\n@MainActor final class MainViewModel: ObservableObject { private var allMovies: [FavoriteWrapper\u0026lt;Movie\u0026gt;] = [] @Published private(set) var movies: [Movie] = [] @Published private(set) var recommendations: [Movie] = [] private let recommendationService: RecommendationService private var recommendationsTask: Task\u0026lt;Void, Never\u0026gt;? init(recommendationService: RecommendationService = RecommendationService()) { self.recommendationService = recommendationService } func loadAllMovies() async { guard let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: \u0026#34;movies\u0026#34;, withExtension: \u0026#34;json\u0026#34;) else { return } do { let data = try Data(contentsOf: url) allMovies = (try JSONDecoder().decode([Movie].self, from: data)).shuffled().map { FavoriteWrapper(model: $0) } movies = allMovies.map(\\.model) } catch { print(error.localizedDescription) } } func didRemove(_ item: Movie, isLiked: Bool) { movies.removeAll { $0.id == item.id } if let index = allMovies.firstIndex(where: { $0.model.id == item.id }) { allMovies[index] = FavoriteWrapper(model: item, isFavorite: isLiked) } recommendationsTask?.cancel() recommendationsTask = Task { do { let result = try await recommendationService.computeRecommendations(basedOn: allMovies) if !Task.isCancelled { recommendations = result } } catch { print(error.localizedDescription) } } } func resetUserChoices() { movies = allMovies.map(\\.model) recommendations = [] } } The final step The final step is to create the UI and connect it with the ViewModel.\nimport SwiftUI struct ContentView: View { @StateObject private var viewModel: MainViewModel init() { _viewModel = StateObject(wrappedValue: MainViewModel()) } var body: some View { NavigationView { ScrollView { VStack(alignment: .leading) { SectionTitleView(text: \u0026#34;Swipe to Like or Dislike\u0026#34;) if viewModel.movies.isEmpty { HStack { Spacer() VStack { Text(\u0026#34;All Done!\u0026#34;) .multilineTextAlignment(.center) .font(.callout) .foregroundColor(.secondary) Button(\u0026#34;Try Again\u0026#34;) { withAnimation { viewModel.resetUserChoices() } } .font(.headline) .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent) } Spacer() } .padding(.horizontal) .padding(.vertical, 32) } else { CardsStackView(models: viewModel.movies) { item, isLiked in withAnimation(.spring()) { viewModel.didRemove(item, isLiked: isLiked) } } .zIndex(1) } RecommendationsView(recommendations: viewModel.recommendations) } } .navigationTitle(\u0026#34;Tmovie´inder!\u0026#34;) .task { await viewModel.loadAllMovies() } } .navigationViewStyle(.stack) } } Resources 🔗 GitHub project 📥 Download materials Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/building-movie-recommendations-using-ml/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was wondering about how to create movie recommendations, so I decided to take a closer look and find out more about this topic.

The Visitor Pattern helps add new capabilities to a composite of objects.\nSource\nWhat problems does it solve? The Visitor Pattern helps solve following problems:\nSeparation of Concerns: The Visitor Pattern separates algorithms from the objects on which they operate. This allows for clean code organization by keeping algorithms and operations separate from the data structures they operate on. Extensibility: It allows you to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures. This is especially useful when dealing with complex object hierarchies where adding new functionality directly to the classes would lead to code bloat and tight coupling. Traversal of Object Structures: It provides a way to traverse complex object structures while performing some action on each element of the structure. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to process every element of a data structure in a specific order or with a specific algorithm.

Pattern"},{"content":"What is a Memento Pattern? The Memento Pattern helps return an object to one of its previous states; for instance, if the user requests an “undo” operation.\nSource\nWhat problems does it solve? The Memento Pattern helps solve following problems:\nUndo/Redo Functionality: Memento allows you to capture an object’s state at a specific point in time and store it externally. This enables you to implement undo/redo functionality by restoring the object to its previous state. Checkpointing: In applications where users need to save progress or create checkpoints (such as in games or long processes), the Memento Pattern allows you to save the state of an object at various intervals so that users can return to those points later. Real-world code example // Memento: Represents the state of the TextEditor struct TextEditorMemento { let text: String } // Originator: Creates and stores states in Memento objects class TextEditor { private var text: String = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; func setText(_ text: String) { self.text = text } func getText() -\u0026gt; String { return text } func save() -\u0026gt; TextEditorMemento { return TextEditorMemento(text: text) } func restore(fromMemento memento: TextEditorMemento) { self.text = memento.text } } // Caretaker: Manages the mementos class TextEditorHistory { private var history: [TextEditorMemento] = [] private let editor: TextEditor init(editor: TextEditor) { self.editor = editor } func save() { let snapshot = editor.save() history.append(snapshot) } func undo() { guard let lastSnapshot = history.popLast() else { print(\u0026#34;Nothing to undo.\u0026#34;) return } editor.restore(fromMemento: lastSnapshot) } func printHistory() { print(\u0026#34;Text Editor History:\u0026#34;) for (index, snapshot) in history.enumerated() { print(\u0026#34;Step \\(index + 1): \\(snapshot.text)\u0026#34;) } print(\u0026#34;Current text: \\(editor.getText())\u0026#34;) } } // Example usage let textEditor = TextEditor() let history = TextEditorHistory(editor: textEditor) textEditor.setText(\u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34;) history.save() textEditor.setText(\u0026#34;This is a Swift example.\u0026#34;) history.save() textEditor.setText(\u0026#34;Using Memento Pattern.\u0026#34;) history.save() history.printHistory() history.undo() print(\u0026#34;After Undo:\u0026#34;) history.printHistory() Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-memento-pattern/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-a-memento-pattern\"\u003eWhat is a Memento Pattern?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Memento Pattern helps return an object to one of its previous states; for instance, if the user requests an “undo” operation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-35972\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-35972\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/0.jpg#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.learncsdesign.com/learn-the-memento-design-pattern/\"\u003eSource\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-problems-does-it-solve\"\u003eWhat problems does it solve?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Memento Pattern helps solve following problems:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUndo/Redo Functionality\u003c/strong\u003e: Memento allows you to capture an object’s state at a specific point in time and store it externally.

Pattern"},{"content":"What is an Interpreter Pattern? The Interpreter Pattern helps implement a simple language and defines a class based representation for its grammar along with an interpreter to interpret its sentences.\nSource\nWhat problems does it solve? The Interpreter Pattern helps solve following problems:\nLanguage Interpretation: When you have a language or syntax that needs to be interpreted, such as mathematical expressions, regular expressions, or domain-specific languages (DSLs), the Interpreter Pattern helps in implementing the logic to interpret and execute these expressions. Extensibility: The Interpreter Pattern allows for easy addition of new grammar rules or language constructs without modifying the core interpreter logic. This promotes extensibility, enabling the interpreter to support new features or languages with minimal changes. Separation of Concerns: It separates the grammar definition from the interpretation logic. This separation of concerns makes the codebase modular and easier to maintain. Changes to the grammar or language rules do not affect the interpretation logic, and vice versa. Real-world code example // Define the protocol for the expression protocol Expression { func interpret() -\u0026gt; Int } // Concrete expression for a number class NumberExpression: Expression { private var value: Int init(_ value: Int) { self.value = value } func interpret() -\u0026gt; Int { return value } } // Concrete expression for addition class AdditionExpression: Expression { private var left: Expression private var right: Expression init(_ left: Expression, _ right: Expression) { self.left = left self.right = right } func interpret() -\u0026gt; Int { return left.interpret() + right.interpret() } } // Concrete expression for subtraction class SubtractionExpression: Expression { private var left: Expression private var right: Expression init(_ left: Expression, _ right: Expression) { self.left = left self.right = right } func interpret() -\u0026gt; Int { return left.interpret() - right.interpret() } } // Concrete expression for multiplication class MultiplicationExpression: Expression { private var left: Expression private var right: Expression init(_ left: Expression, _ right: Expression) { self.left = left self.right = right } func interpret() -\u0026gt; Int { return left.interpret() * right.interpret() } } // Concrete expression for division class DivisionExpression: Expression { private var left: Expression private var right: Expression init(_ left: Expression, _ right: Expression) { self.left = left self.right = right } func interpret() -\u0026gt; Int { let divisor = right.interpret() if divisor != 0 { return left.interpret() / divisor } else { // Handle division by zero error fatalError(\u0026#34;Division by zero\u0026#34;) } } } // Usage let expression = AdditionExpression( MultiplicationExpression(NumberExpression(2), NumberExpression(3)), DivisionExpression(NumberExpression(10), NumberExpression(5)) ) // Interpret the expression let result = expression.interpret() print(\u0026#34;Result: \\(result)\u0026#34;) Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-interpreter-pattern/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-an-interpreter-pattern\"\u003eWhat is an Interpreter Pattern?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Interpreter Pattern helps implement a simple language and defines a class based representation for its grammar along with an interpreter to interpret its sentences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-35972\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-35972\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/0.jpg#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.cs.unc.edu/~stotts/GOF/hires/pat5cfso.htm\"\u003eSource\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-problems-does-it-solve\"\u003eWhat problems does it solve?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Interpreter Pattern helps solve following problems:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLanguage Interpretation\u003c/strong\u003e: When you have a language or syntax that needs to be interpreted, such as mathematical expressions, regular expressions, or domain-specific languages (DSLs), the Interpreter Pattern helps in implementing the logic to interpret and execute these expressions.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExtensibility\u003c/strong\u003e: The Interpreter Pattern allows for easy addition of new grammar rules or language constructs without modifying the core interpreter logic.

Pattern"},{"content":"What is a Flyweight Pattern? The Flyweight Pattern refers to an object that minimizes memory usage by sharing some of its data with other similar objects.\nSource\nWhat problems does it solve? The Flyweight Pattern helps solve following problems:\nLarge Memory Footprint: When dealing with a large number of objects, especially if these objects share a significant amount of common state, traditional object creation can lead to excessive memory consumption. The Flyweight Pattern reduces memory usage by sharing this common state among multiple objects. Performance Overhead: Creating and managing a large number of objects can also introduce performance overhead due to memory allocation, deallocation, and initialization. By reusing shared objects and minimizing the creation of new objects, the Flyweight Pattern can improve performance. Object Creation Cost: Creating new objects can be costly in terms of time and resources, especially if the objects require complex initialization. By reusing existing objects, the Flyweight Pattern reduces the need for creating new objects, thereby reducing object creation costs.

The Chain Of Responsibility Pattern helps create a chain of objects to examine requests. Each object in turn examines a request and either handles it or passes onto the next object in the chain.\nSource\nWhat problems does it solve? The Chain Of Responsibility Pattern (CoR) helps solve following problems:\nDynamic Request Handling: It enables dynamic assignment of responsibilities at runtime. Handlers can be added, removed, or reordered without affecting the client’s code. This flexibility allows for easier maintenance and extension of the system. Decoupling Sender and Receiver: In traditional systems, a sender often needs to know the exact receiver of a request, leading to tight coupling between them. The CoR pattern decouples senders from receivers by allowing multiple objects to handle a request without the sender knowing the specific handler. Real-world code example // Protocol defining the handler interface protocol PurchaseHandler { var next: PurchaseHandler? { get set } func handleRequest(amount: Double) } // Concrete handlers class SmallPurchaseHandler: PurchaseHandler { var next: PurchaseHandler? let maxAmount: Double = 100.0 func handleRequest(amount: Double) { if amount \u0026lt;= maxAmount { print(\u0026#34;SmallPurchaseHandler: Purchase approved for $\\(amount)\u0026#34;) } else if let nextHandler = next { print(\u0026#34;SmallPurchaseHandler: Passing request to next handler\u0026#34;) nextHandler.handleRequest(amount: amount) } else { print(\u0026#34;SmallPurchaseHandler: No handler available, purchase rejected\u0026#34;) } } } class MediumPurchaseHandler: PurchaseHandler { var next: PurchaseHandler? let maxAmount: Double = 500.0 func handleRequest(amount: Double) { if amount \u0026lt;= maxAmount { print(\u0026#34;MediumPurchaseHandler: Purchase approved for $\\(amount)\u0026#34;) } else if let nextHandler = next { print(\u0026#34;MediumPurchaseHandler: Passing request to next handler\u0026#34;) nextHandler.handleRequest(amount: amount) } else { print(\u0026#34;MediumPurchaseHandler: No handler available, purchase rejected\u0026#34;) } } } class LargePurchaseHandler: PurchaseHandler { var next: PurchaseHandler? func handleRequest(amount: Double) { print(\u0026#34;LargePurchaseHandler: Purchase approved for $\\(amount)\u0026#34;) } } // Usage func main() { let smallHandler = SmallPurchaseHandler() let mediumHandler = MediumPurchaseHandler() let largeHandler = LargePurchaseHandler() // Connecting handlers into a chain smallHandler.next = mediumHandler mediumHandler.next = largeHandler smallHandler.handleRequest(amount: 50.0) smallHandler.handleRequest(amount: 200.0) smallHandler.handleRequest(amount: 1000.0) } Thank you for reading! 😊 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-chain-of-responsibility-pattern/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-a-chain-of-responsibility-pattern\"\u003eWhat is a Chain Of Responsibility Pattern?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chain Of Responsibility Pattern helps create a chain of objects to examine requests.

😊\u003c/h4\u003e","title":"The Chain Of Responsibility Pattern"},{"content":"What is a State Pattern? The State Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.\nSource\nWhat problems does it solve? Complex conditional logic: When an object’s behavior depends on its internal state, it often leads to complex conditional statements. The State pattern simplifies this by encapsulating each state and its behavior in separate classes, making the code more readable and maintainable. State-specific behavior: Objects often need to change their behavior based on their state. The State pattern allows objects to delegate behavior to state objects, which can vary independently. This promotes better encapsulation and separation of concerns. Adding new states: When new states need to be added, the State pattern makes it easier to extend the functionality without modifying existing code. New states can be added by creating new state classes and integrating them into the existing context, without changing the context class itself.

Combine Framework provides an API for processing async events over time such as user-input, network response, and other dynamic data.\nWhat is the purpose of Combine? The purpose of Combine is to simplify the management of async events and data streams.\nPublishers Publisher declares that a type can transit a sequence of values over time. A publisher delivers elements to one or more Subscriber instances.\nclass PostService { func fetchPosts() -\u0026gt; AnyPublisher\u0026lt;[Post], Error\u0026gt; { guard let url = URL(string: \u0026#34;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts\u0026#34;) else { fatalError(\u0026#34;Invalid URL\u0026#34;) } return URLSession.shared.dataTaskPublisher(for: url) .map(\\.data) .decode(type: [Post].self, decoder: JSONDecoder()) .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main) .eraseToAnyPublisher() } } Subscribers Subscriber is a protocol that declares a type that can receive input from a publisher. A Subscriber instance receives a stream of elements from a Publisher.\nprivate var cancellable: AnyCancellable? let service = PostService() cancellable = service.fetchPosts() .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in switch completion { case .finished: break case .failure(let error): print(error.localizedDescription) } }, receiveValue: { posts in print(\u0026#34;Received posts count:\u0026#34;, posts.count) }) AnyCancellable When you call a method like sink or assign on a publisher, it returns a type that conforms to the Cancellable protocol. Storing this return value in an instance of AnyCancellable keeps the subscription active. When the AnyCancellable instance is deallocated, its deinit method automatically cancels the subscription.\nvar cancellables = Set\u0026lt;AnyCancellable\u0026gt;() let publisher = Just(\u0026#34;Hello, Combine!\u0026#34;) publisher .sink { completion in print(\u0026#34;Completion: \\(completion)\u0026#34;) } receiveValue: { value in print(\u0026#34;Received value: \\(value)\u0026#34;) } .store(in: \u0026amp;cancellables) Operators Transforming Operators map: Transforms each value received from a publisher by applying a function. flatMap: Transforms each value received into a new publisher, then flattens the result into a single publisher stream. scan: Applies a closure over the previous result and the current value to produce a new value, useful for accumulating values. Filtering Operators filter: Emits only those values from a publisher that satisfy a given predicate. removeDuplicates: Suppresses duplicate consecutive values published by a publisher. first/last: Emits only the first or last value from a publisher that satisfies a predicate condition. Combining Operators combineLatest: Combines the latest value from two or more publishers and emits a combined value each time any of the publishers emit a value. merge: Combines multiple publishers of the same type into a single publisher stream, emitting values as they arrive. zip: Combines values from multiple publishers into tuples, emitting a tuple only when each of the publishers has emitted a new value. Error Handling Operators catch: Handles errors from a publisher by replacing the failed publisher with another publisher or a value. retry: Attempts to recreate a subscription to a failed publisher for a specified number of times. Utility Operators delay: Delays the emission of items from the publisher for a specified interval. subscribe(on:)/receive(on:): Specifies the dispatch queue for performing subscription work or receiving values. print: Prints log messages for all publisher events to the console, useful for debugging. Timing Operators debounce: Emits a value from a publisher only after a specified time interval has passed without receiving another value. throttle: Emits either the first or last value received in a specified time window. Collecting Operators collect: Collects received values and emits an array of those values either when the publisher completes or when a buffer size is reached. When to use Combine? I found great advice from Apple when it comes to Combine:\n“A Combine publisher fills a role similar to, but distinct from, the AsyncSequence in the Swift standard library. A Publisher and an AsyncSequence both produce elements over time. However, the pull model in Combine uses a Subscriber to request elements from a publisher, while Swift concurrency uses the for-await-in syntax to iterate over elements published by an AsyncSequence. Both APIs offer methods to modify the sequence by mapping or filtering elements, while only Combine provides time-based operations like debounce(for:scheduler:options:) and throttle(for:scheduler:latest:), and combining operations like merge(with:) and combineLatest(_:_:). To bridge the two approaches, the property values exposes a publisher’s elements as an AsyncSequence, allowing you to iterate over them with for-await-in rather than attaching a Subscriber.”\nThank you for reading!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/combine-basics/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-combine\"\u003eWhat is Combine?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCombine Framework provides an API for processing async events over time such as user-input, network response, and other dynamic data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-the-purpose-of-combine\"\u003eWhat is the purpose of Combine?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe purpose of Combine is to simplify the management of async events and data streams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"publishers\"\u003ePublishers\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003ePublisher\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e declares that a type can transit a sequence of values over time.

It was introduced in Swift 5.5 at WWDC 2021.\nYou can find the more comprehensive info about Modern Concurrency in Swift Concurrency Manifesto.\nWhat are actors? Actors eliminate shared mutable state and explicit synchronization through deep copying of all the data that passed to an actor to a message sent and preventing direct access to actor state. Actors are reference types.\nactor DatabaseManager { private var data: [String: String] = [:] func readData(key: String) -\u0026gt; String? { data[key] } func writeData(key: String, value: String) { data[key] = value } } What is an asynchronous function? The asynchronous function or asynchronous method can be suspended while it is partway through execution. It can pause in the middle when it’s waiting for something.\nfunc someAsyncOperation(index: Int) async throws -\u0026gt; String { try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1_000_000_000) return \u0026#34;Operation \\(index) Completed\u0026#34; } func performAsyncOperations() async throws { for index in 1...1000 { Task.detached { print(\u0026#34;Start of operation \\(index)\u0026#34;) let result = try await someAsyncOperation(index: index) print(\u0026#34;End of operation \\(index) with result: \\(result)\u0026#34;) return result } } } Task { print(\u0026#34;Start of example\u0026#34;) try await performAsyncOperationsWithYield() print(\u0026#34;End of example\u0026#34;) } What are Asynchronous Sequences? Asynchronous Sequences enable you to stop an async task until the next item is prepared, giving room for other tasks to progress. Crafting your own Asynchronous Sequence involves adhering to the AsyncSequence protocol.\nstruct AsyncCounter: AsyncSequence { typealias Element = Int struct AsyncCounterIterator: AsyncIteratorProtocol { var count = 0 mutating func next() async -\u0026gt; Int? { defer { count += 1 } return count } } func makeAsyncIterator() -\u0026gt; AsyncCounterIterator { return AsyncCounterIterator() } } let asyncCounter = AsyncCounter() for await count in asyncCounter { print(\u0026#34;Count: \\(count)\u0026#34;) try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1 * 1_000_000_000) } What are Tasks and TaskGroups? You can draw a parallel between Tasks and DispatchQueue`s because they have similar concepts. If you want to execute your code asynchronously you should put your code into async context. Tasks and Queues help you solve this problem.\nfunc fetchData() async throws -\u0026gt; String { try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 2 * 1_000_000_000) return \u0026#34;Data fetched successfully!\u0026#34; } Task { print(\u0026#34;Start fetching data...\u0026#34;) do { let result = try await fetchData() print(result) } catch { print(\u0026#34;Error: \\(error)\u0026#34;) } print(\u0026#34;Data fetching completed.\u0026#34;) } let customQueue = DispatchQueue(label: \u0026#34;com.example.myqueue\u0026#34;, attributes: .concurrent) func performTask() { customQueue.async { print(\u0026#34;Task is starting...\u0026#34;) Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 2) print(\u0026#34;Task completed.\u0026#34;) } } for _ in 1...3 { performTask() } TaskGroup allows you to explicitly add child tasks and give you more control over priority and cancellation.\nfunc fetchImages(urls: [URL]) async throws -\u0026gt; [UIImage] { try await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: UIImage.self) { group in var images: [UIImage] = [] for url in urls { group.addTask { try await downloadImage(from: url) } } for try await result in group { images.append(result) } return images } } func downloadImage(from url: URL) async throws -\u0026gt; UIImage { // Download and return the image } What is Task.yield()? If you have a long-running operation you can call the Task.yield() method to explicitly add suspension points. By doing that you are letting other tasks make progress.\nfunc performAsyncOperationsWithYield() async throws { for index in 1...1000 { Task.detached { print(\u0026#34;Start of operation \\(index)\u0026#34;) // Yield control to the scheduler await Task.yield() let result = try await someAsyncOperation(index: index) print(\u0026#34;End of operation \\(index) with result: \\(result)\u0026#34;) return result } } } What are Sendable Types? A type that can be shared from one concurrency context to another is known as a sendable type. In other words it guarantees that the operation that you perform is thread-safe.\nimport Foundation struct WeatherData: Sendable { var temperature: Double var condition: String var city: String } func fetchWeatherData(forCity city: String) async -\u0026gt; WeatherData { try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1_000_000_000) return WeatherData(temperature: 72.0, condition: \u0026#34;Sunny\u0026#34;, city: city) } import SwiftUI @MainActor class WeatherViewModel: ObservableObject { @Published var currentWeather: WeatherData? func updateWeather(forCity city: String) { Task { let weatherData = await fetchWeatherData(forCity: city) // Since WeatherData conforms to Sendable, this is safe self.currentWeather = weatherData } } } Thank you for reading!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/modern-concurrency/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"when-was-it-introduced\"\u003eWhen was it introduced?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was introduced in \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/swift-5.5-RELEASE\"\u003eSwift 5.5\u003c/a\u003e at \u003ca href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2021/\"\u003eWWDC 2021\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can find the more comprehensive info about Modern Concurrency in \u003ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/lattner/31ed37682ef1576b16bca1432ea9f782#swift-concurrency-manifesto\"\u003eSwift Concurrency Manifesto\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-are-actors\"\u003eWhat are actors?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/concurrency/#Actors\"\u003eActors\u003c/a\u003e eliminate shared mutable state and explicit synchronization through deep copying of all the data that passed to an actor to a message sent and preventing direct access to actor state.

A Thread is a small set of instructions that can be executed independently from the main program. Threads are often used to improve program performance by allowing multiple tasks to be executed at the same time. The Thread has its own stack, registers, and program counters.\nThreads share memory address space, and it is possible to communicate between Threads using shared memory space. How to use it? You can create a single Thread by the following example:\n// Create a new thread and start it let newThread = Thread { } newThread.start() What else can you do? You can:\ncancel exit sleep etc You can check the current Thread execution state: isExecuting isFinished isCancelled You can subclass Thread and override the main() method if you need it.\nCaveats The main problem with Threads is that you must manually manage relationships between them. It can cause testability, readability, and potentially Thread Explosion issues.\nWhat is Thread Explosion? Thread Explosion occurs when a system has too many running Threads simultaneously. It can cause performance issues such as memory overhead and cost of context switching (CPU cycles).\nTips You can delegate your work with Threads to Grand Central Dispatch (GCD).\nGCD provides an API that manages the number of Threads automatically.\nYou can also use async/await and Task functionality from Swift 5.5 that helps manage the number of Threads in poll-based factors like system load and the number of available CPUs.

DispatchGroup provides a mechanism to track the completion group of tasks.\nHow DispatchGroup works? DispatchGroup has three main methods, enter, leave and notify, that allow you to control the completion of a specific task.\nlet dispatchGroup = DispatchGroup() dispatchGroup.enter() dispatchGroup.leave() dispatchGroup.notify(queue: .main) {} Let`s talk about each of these methods. enter — manually indicate a block has entered group. leave — manually indicate a block in the group has been completed. notify(queue: ) — schedule a block to be submitted to a queue when all the blocks associated with a group have been completed. The queue parameter is the queue to which the supplied block will be submitted when the group is complete.\nHow to implement DispatchGroup? You can implement DispatchGroup following these steps:\nlet dispatchGroup = DispatchGroup() dispatchGroup.enter() fetchGitHubUser1 { print(\u0026#34;fetchGitHubUser1 task completed\u0026#34;) dispatchGroup.leave() } dispatchGroup.enter() fetchGitHubUser2 { print(\u0026#34;fetchGitHubUser2 task completed\u0026#34;) dispatchGroup.leave() } dispatchGroup.notify(queue: .main) { print(\u0026#34;All tasks completed\u0026#34;) } // prints fetchGitHubUser1 task started fetchGitHubUser2 task started fetchGitHubUser1 task completed fetchGitHubUser2 task completed All tasks completed Pros You can create a group of tasks and track when all tasks finish their work. You can specify a queue where you want to be notified about completed operations.\nCons You should manually manage enter and leave operations that increase complexity and the chance of error.

The system can perform multiple tasks simultaneously. By tasks, I mean code or instructions. Modern computer chips have multiple cores that allow developers to create and run various tasks on multiple cores. Even if your chip has one core operating system it will provide context switching mechanism by enabling it to execute multiple tasks concurrently.\nMaterial about processes, threads I will skip explaining concepts about processes and threads because it is a vast topic, and it will take a lot of time to explain it. I attached links to the material to help you understand it more deeply. https://youtu.be/4rLW7zg21gI?si=49hq8Wrbpmeev41k https://youtu.be/r2__Rw8vu1M?si=b7b257Qu4Bty7OxA I will focus on implementation.\nThe old and modern way of implementing concurrency You can divide concurrency implementation into old or unstructured and modern or structured.\nBy old, I mean GCD (Grand Central Dispatch). By modern, I mean async/await, actor, and Task.\nIn this article, I will talk about the old way. GCD helps you keep your distance from manually managing threads and avoid unnecessary complexity, and it does it by providing API. One of these APIs is DispatchQueue.\nDispatchQueue By default, DispatchQueue is serial; all work on this queue will be executed sequentially. DispatchQueue has access to the main property and the global() method. The main property returns the serial queue associated with the main thread of the current process. The global() method returns a concurrent queue specified by quality-of-service level.\npublic class func global(qos: DispatchQoS.QoSClass = .default) -\u0026gt; DispatchQueue You can pass many parameters when you try to initialize a new queue.\npublic convenience init(label: String, qos: DispatchQoS = .unspecified, attributes: DispatchQueue.Attributes = [], autoreleaseFrequency: DispatchQueue.AutoreleaseFrequency = .inherit, target: DispatchQueue? = nil) Let’s talk about three of them (label, qos, attributes). The first is label, which is used mainly for debugging and identification.\nlet queue = DispatchQueue(label: \u0026#34;com.example.myqueue\u0026#34;) The second one is qos (Quality Of Service) allows you to choose the priority in which you like to run your task. You can choose between background, utility, default, userInitiated, userIneractive, and unspecified priorities.\n/// qos_class_t public struct DispatchQoS : Equatable { public let qosClass: DispatchQoS.QoSClass public let relativePriority: Int @available(macOS 10.10, iOS 8.0, *) public static let background: DispatchQoS @available(macOS 10.10, iOS 8.0, *) public static let utility: DispatchQoS @available(macOS 10.10, iOS 8.0, *) public static let `default`: DispatchQoS @available(macOS 10.10, iOS 8.0, *) public static let userInitiated: DispatchQoS @available(macOS 10.10, iOS 8.0, *) public static let userInteractive: DispatchQoS public static let unspecified: DispatchQoS } userIneractive has the highest priority; it usually calls when you need to display UI almost immediately.\nbackground, on the other hand, has the lowest priority.\nHow to achieve concurrency with DispatchQueue API? You can use a serial queue with the following: sync functionality allows you to wait until the block you passed finishes its work.\nlet serialQueue = DispatchQueue(label: \u0026#34;com.example.myqueue.serial\u0026#34;) serialQueue.sync {} async functionality will schedule your work and be executed later in time.\nlet serialQueue = DispatchQueue(label: \u0026#34;com.example.myqueue.serial\u0026#34;) serialQueue.async {} Or you can use a concurrent queue with similar methods but running your task in parallel.\nlet concurrentQueue = DispatchQueue(label: \u0026#34;com.example.myqueue.concurrent\u0026#34;, attributes: .concurrent) concurrentQueue.sync {} concurrentQueue.async {} The difference between serial queue and concurrent queue The difference between a serial and concurrent queue is that you should not wait until the concurrent operation finishes work in the async block.\nlet concurrentQueue = DispatchQueue(label: \u0026#34;com.example.myqueue.concurrent\u0026#34;, attributes: .concurrent) concurrentQueue.sync { for i in 1...5 { print(\u0026#34;Task \\(i) is running on Concurrent Queue\u0026#34;) sleep(1) // Simulate some work } } concurrentQueue.sync { for i in 6...10 { print(\u0026#34;Task \\(i) is running on Concurrent Queue\u0026#34;) sleep(1) // Simulate some work } } // prints Task 1 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 6 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 2 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 7 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 3 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 8 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 4 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 9 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 5 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 10 is running on Concurrent Queue The serial queue executes tasks in order, and you should wait until the first async block finishes its work to start the second block.\nlet serialQueue = DispatchQueue(label: \u0026#34;com.example.myqueue.serual\u0026#34;) serialQueue.sync { for i in 1...5 { print(\u0026#34;Task \\(i) is running on Serial Queue\u0026#34;) sleep(1) // Simulate some work } } serialQueue.sync { for i in 6...10 { print(\u0026#34;Task \\(i) is running on Serial Queue\u0026#34;) sleep(1) // Simulate some work } } // prints Task 1 is running on Serial Queue Task 2 is running on Serial Queue Task 3 is running on Serial Queue Task 4 is running on Serial Queue Task 5 is running on Serial Queue Task 6 is running on Serial Queue Task 7 is running on Serial Queue Task 8 is running on Serial Queue Task 9 is running on Serial Queue Task 10 is running on Serial Queue When you try to use the sync functionality, it behaves similarly on serial and concurrent queues by executing each task step by step and waiting till each block finishes its work.\nlet serialQueue = DispatchQueue(label: \u0026#34;com.example.myqueue.serial\u0026#34;) serialQueue.sync { for i in 1...5 { print(\u0026#34;Task \\(i) is running on Serial Queue\u0026#34;) sleep(1) // Simulate some work } } serialQueue.sync { for i in 6...10 { print(\u0026#34;Task \\(i) is running on Serial Queue\u0026#34;) sleep(1) // Simulate some work } } // prints Task 1 is running on Serial Queue Task 2 is running on Serial Queue Task 3 is running on Serial Queue Task 4 is running on Serial Queue Task 5 is running on Serial Queue Task 6 is running on Serial Queue Task 7 is running on Serial Queue Task 8 is running on Serial Queue Task 9 is running on Serial Queue Task 10 is running on Serial Queue let concurrentQueue = DispatchQueue(label: \u0026#34;com.example.myqueue.concurrent\u0026#34;, attributes: .concurrent) concurrentQueue.sync { for i in 1...5 { print(\u0026#34;Task \\(i) is running on Concurrent Queue\u0026#34;) sleep(1) // Simulate some work } } concurrentQueue.sync { for i in 6...10 { print(\u0026#34;Task \\(i) is running on Concurrent Queue\u0026#34;) sleep(1) // Simulate some work } } // prints Task 1 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 2 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 3 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 4 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 5 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 6 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 7 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 8 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 9 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 10 is running on Concurrent Queue ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/concurrency-in-swift/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-concurrency\"\u003eWhat is concurrency?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe system can perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

To do that, you need to open Simulator and try some cases that could cause memory leaks.\nAfter you spend some time trying different scenarios, you can see that Instruments found Leaked Objects. Another way to find memory leaks is by using Debug Memory Graph in Xcode Debug Area. Inside Debug Memory Graph, you can find MemoryLeaks section. MemoryLeaks section displays what objects have strong reference cycles between themselves.\nAll tools above have opportunity to find and highlight potential issues and help you resolve them.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-to-find-memory-leaks/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe common way to find memory leaks is by using Xcode Instruments.\nAll you need is the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen Xcode Instruments\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChoose Leaks option\n\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-3a9c2\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-3a9c2\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/1.jpg#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelect Simulator where you are going to test your application\n\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-956ad\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-956ad\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/2.jpg#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelect your installed application\n\n    \n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zoomCheck-1ab49\" hidden\u003e\n    \u003clabel for=\"zoomCheck-1ab49\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg class=\"zoomCheck\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" \n            src=\"images/3.jpg#center\" alt=\"alt image\" \n             /\u003e\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you finish preparation, you can start immediate recoding and check application for leaks.

Swift uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) to track and manage your app’s memory usage. In most cases, this means that memory management “just works” in Swift, and you don’t need to think about memory management yourself. ARC automatically frees up the memory used by class instances when those instances are no longer needed. - Apple\nARC In Action In this example, we assign an instance to the reference1 property.\nnumber of references equals 1. class Storage { let data: Data init(data: Data) { self.data = data print(\u0026#34;\\(Self.self) is being initialized\u0026#34;) } deinit { print(\u0026#34;\\(Self.self) is being deinitialized\u0026#34;) } } var reference1: Storage? var reference2: Storage? var reference3: Storage? reference1 = Storage(data: Data()) Now we can assign a reference to another two properties, reference2 and reference3. Whenever you assign a reference, you increase the counter.\nnumber of references equals 3. reference2 = reference1 reference3 = reference1 When you set reference2 and reference3 to nil, the number of references equals 1.\nreference2 = nil reference3 = nil Only when you set reference1 to nil object will be deinitialized.\nreference1 = nil Memory leaks Memory leaks appear when you have strong references between two instances that point to each other.\nIn this example, class Employee has optional department property, and class Department has optional employee property.\nclass Department { let name: String init(name: String) { self.name = name print(\u0026#34;\\(Self.self) is being initialized\u0026#34;) } var employee: Employee? deinit { print(\u0026#34;\\(Self.self) is being deinitialized\u0026#34;) } } class Employee { let name: String init(name: String) { self.name = name print(\u0026#34;\\(Self.self) is being initialized\u0026#34;) } var department: Department? deinit { print(\u0026#34;\\(Self.self) is being deinitialized\u0026#34;) } } var employee: Employee? var department: Department? employee = Employee(name: \u0026#34;John Doe\u0026#34;) department = Department(name: \u0026#34;Research and development\u0026#34;) If we try to assign Department reference to employee property and Employee reference to department property, it creates a memory leak by strong references that point to each other.\nemployee!.department = department department!.employee = employee If you try to set employee and department properties to nil, then these two objects can’t be deallocated because of the existing strong reference relationship between both objects.\nemployee = nil department = nil To avoid this unpleasant situation, we can use weak, unowned references.\nWeak reference If you use a weak keyword before a property, you say that this property should not keep a strong reference. Weak property should always be mutable and optional because ARC set the property to nil after the instance was deallocated.\nIn this example, Employee instance has department property with weak keyword. It means when we set employee property to nil ARC sets department property to nil and deallocates Department instance.\nclass Department { let name: String init(name: String) { self.name = name print(\u0026#34;\\(Self.self) is being initialized\u0026#34;) } var employee: Employee? deinit { print(\u0026#34;\\(Self.self) is being deinitialized\u0026#34;) } } class Employee { let name: String init(name: String) { self.name = name print(\u0026#34;\\(Self.self) is being initialized\u0026#34;) } weak var department: Department? deinit { print(\u0026#34;\\(Self.self) is being deinitialized\u0026#34;) } } var employee: Employee? var department: Department? employee = Employee(name: \u0026#34;John Doe\u0026#34;) department = Department(name: \u0026#34;Research and development\u0026#34;) employee!.department = department department!.employee = employee department = nil employee = nil Unowned reference Unowned reference can’t be optional, and it should always have value. If you try to access a deallocated property value, you will face a runtime error.\nIn this example, we have two instances: User and DiscountCard. DiscountCard has a relationship with the User that is marked as unowned to avoid a strong reference cycle.\nclass User { let name: String var discountCard: DiscountCard? init(name: String) { self.name = name } deinit { print(\u0026#34;\\(Self.self) is being deinitialized\u0026#34;) } } class DiscountCard { let number: UInt64 unowned let user: User init(number: UInt64, user: User) { self.number = number self.user = user } deinit { print(\u0026#34;\\(Self.self) is being deinitialized\u0026#34;) } } var user: User? user = User(name: \u0026#34;John Doe\u0026#34;) When you create DiscountCard instance and assign it as reference to user property, it no longer holds strong reference.\nuser!.discountCard = DiscountCard(number: 1234_5678_9012_3456, user: user!) After we set user property to nil, it will deallocate User and DiscountCard instances.\nuser = nil Strong Reference Cycles for Closures Strong reference cycle for closure can occur if you assign closure to property of instance. In this case, you assign reference to that closure. The strong reference cycle appears because closures are reference types.\nclass MemoryStorage { let text: String let additionalText: String? lazy var copy: () -\u0026gt; String = { if let additionalText = self.additionalText { self.text + \u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34; + additionalText } else { self.text } } init(text: String, additionalText: String? = nil) { self.text = text self.additionalText = additionalText } deinit { print(\u0026#34;\\(Self.self) is being deinitialized\u0026#34;) } } var memoryStorage: MemoryStorage? = MemoryStorage(text: \u0026#34;Thank you for registration\u0026#34;, additionalText: \u0026#34;John Doe\u0026#34;) print(memoryStorage!.copy()) memoryStorage = nil In this example, closure captures self.text property and create strong reference cycle by referencing to self.\nBreaking Strong Reference Cycle in Closure To break strong reference cycle, we need to add capture list with unowned keyword to copy closure.\nclass MemoryStorage { let text: String let additionalText: String? lazy var copy: () -\u0026gt; String = { [unowned self] in if let additionalText = self.additionalText { self.text + \u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34; + additionalText } else { self.text } } init(text: String, additionalText: String? = nil) { self.text = text self.additionalText = additionalText } deinit { print(\u0026#34;\\(Self.self) is being deinitialized\u0026#34;) } } var memoryStorage: MemoryStorage? = MemoryStorage(text: \u0026#34;Thank you for registration\u0026#34;, additionalText: \u0026#34;John Doe\u0026#34;) print(memoryStorage!.copy()) memoryStorage = nil ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/arc-in-swift/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-arc\"\u003eWhat is ARC?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) to track and manage your app’s memory usage.
