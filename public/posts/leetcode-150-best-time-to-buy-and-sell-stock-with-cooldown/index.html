You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:\nAfter you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day). Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).\nExample 1:\nInput: prices = [1,2,3,0,2] Output: 3 Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell] Example 2:\nInput: prices = [1] Output: 0 Constraints:\n1 \u003c= prices.length \u003c= 5000 0 \u003c= prices[i] \u003c= 1000 Explanation From the description of the problem, we learn that we are given an array of prices and we need to maximize profit. We also learn that we can make as many transactions as we like, but with a couple of restrictions: we can’t buy a stock and sell it on the same day, we must have one cooldown day, and we can’t buy multiple stocks simultaneously; we must buy and sell stocks one by one.\nDynamic Programming (Top-Down) Solution func maxProfit(_ prices: [Int]) -\u003e Int { var dp: [Helper: Int] = [:] func dfs(_ i: Int, _ buying: Bool) -\u003e Int { if i \u003e= prices.count { return 0 } if let cached = dp[Helper(i: i, buying: buying)] { return cached } let cooldown = dfs(i + 1, buying) if buying { let buy = dfs(i + 1, false) - prices[i] dp[Helper(i: i, buying: buying)] = max(buy, cooldown) } else { let sell = dfs(i + 2, true) + prices[i] dp[Helper(i: i, buying: buying)] = max(sell, cooldown) } return dp[Helper(i: i, buying: buying)]! } return dfs(0, true) } struct Helper: Hashable { let i: Int let buying: Bool } Explanation We have three choices: we can buy or sell stock, or we can have a cooldown and do nothing.\nWe can better understand the problem by visualizing it in the form of a decision tree. If we decide to buy stock on the first day (that has price 1), our profit equals -1. If we decide not to buy stock on the first day (by using cooldown), our profit equals 0. On the second day, we can choose to sell, buy stock, or use cooldown. If we sell stock on the second day, we must do a day of cooldown, and only after that can we buy a new stock. Lastly, if we continue moving along our previous path, we can sell or take a day of cooldown. While we are moving recursively along our decision tree, we are going to find the maximum price in leaf nodes and update our result.\nIn order to buy stock, we are going to increment our index by 1; as for selling, we are going to increment the index by 2.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Thank you for reading! 😊 ",

<p>We have three choices: we can <strong>buy</strong> or <strong>sell</strong> stock, or we can have a <strong>cooldown</strong> and do nothing.</p>
<p>We can better understand the problem by visualizing it in the form of a decision tree.

    
    <input type="checkbox" id="zoomCheck-a5250" hidden>
    <label for="zoomCheck-a5250">
        <img class="zoomCheck" loading="lazy" decoding="async" 
            src="images/309.png#center" alt="alt image" 
             />
    </label>
</p>
<ul>
<li>If we decide to buy stock on the first day (that has price <code>1</code>), our <strong>profit equals -1</strong>.</li>
<li>If we decide not to buy stock on the first day (by using <strong>cooldown</strong>), our <strong>profit equals 0</strong>.

    
    <input type="checkbox" id="zoomCheck-46a85" hidden>
    <label for="zoomCheck-46a85">
        <img class="zoomCheck" loading="lazy" decoding="async" 
            src="images/309-1.png#center" alt="alt image" 
             />
    </label>
</li>
<li>On the second day, we can choose to <strong>sell</strong>, <strong>buy</strong> stock, or use <strong>cooldown</strong>.

    
    <input type="checkbox" id="zoomCheck-5b2ea" hidden>
    <label for="zoomCheck-5b2ea">
        <img class="zoomCheck" loading="lazy" decoding="async" 
            src="images/309-2.png#center" alt="alt image" 
             />
    </label>
</li>
<li>If we sell stock on the second day, we must do a day of <strong>cooldown</strong>, and only after that can we <strong>buy</strong> a new stock.

    
    <input type="checkbox" id="zoomCheck-faf87" hidden>
    <label for="zoomCheck-faf87">
        <img class="zoomCheck" loading="lazy" decoding="async" 
            src="images/309-3.png#center" alt="alt image" 
             />
    </label>
</li>
<li>Lastly, if we continue moving along our previous path, we can <strong>sell</strong> or take a day of <strong>cooldown</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While we are moving recursively along our decision tree, we are going to find the <strong>maximum price</strong> in leaf nodes and update our result.</p>
<p>In order to <strong>buy</strong> stock, we are going to increment our index by <code>1</code>; as for <strong>selling</strong>, we are going to increment the index by <code>2</code>.</p>
