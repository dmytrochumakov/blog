The speed of the car fleet is the minimum speed of any car in the fleet.\nIf a car catches up to a car fleet at the mile target, it will still be considered as part of the car fleet.\nReturn the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.\nExamples Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3] Output: 3 Explanation: * The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12. The fleet forms at target. * The car starting at 0 (speed 1) does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself. * The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target. Input: target = 10, position = [3], speed = [3] Output: 1 Explanation: There is only one car, hence there is only one fleet. Input: target = 100, position = [0,2,4], speed = [4,2,1] Output: 1 Explanation: * The cars starting at 0 (speed 4) and 2 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each other at 4. The car starting at 4 (speed 1) travels to 5. * Then, the fleet at 4 (speed 2) and the car at position 5 (speed 1) become one fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target. Constraints n == position.length == speed.length 1 \u003c= n \u003c= 10^5 0 \u003c target \u003c= 10^6 0 \u003c= position[i] \u003c target All the values of position are unique. 0 \u003c speed[i] \u003c= 10^6 Explanation Before we jump into the solution, let’s draw a visual representation of two cars that are traveling with different speeds and different positions. The first car is traveling with speed 10 miles per hour and it’s first in the line. The second car is traveling with speed 20 miles per hour and it’s second in the line. The faster car will eventually catch up and will be travelling with the same speed as the first car because the road has a single line. When the faster car catches up, its speed will be reduced to the speed of the slower one. Once cars are traveling next to each other, that is called a car fleet and cars are assumed to have the same exact position. Stack Solution func carFleet(_ target: Int, _ position: [Int], _ speed: [Int]) -\u003e Int { let pair = zip(position, speed).sorted { $0.0 \u003e $1.0 } var stack: [Double] = [] for (p, s) in pair { stack.append(Double(target - p) / Double(s)) if stack.count \u003e= 2 \u0026\u0026 stack[stack.count - 1] \u003c= stack[stack.count - 2] { stack.removeLast() } } return stack.count } Explanation Let’s look at another example with [position, speed] = [[3, 3], [5, 2], [7, 1]] We start with position 3 and speed 3:\nAt one second, it will be at position 6; at two seconds, it will be at position 9; and at three seconds, it will be at position 12. Next, the position starts at 5 and speed 2:\nAt one second, it will be at position 7; at two seconds, it will be at position 9; and at three seconds, it will be at position 11. Lastly, we have position 7 and speed 1:\nAt one second, it will be at position 8; at two seconds, it will be at position 9; and at three seconds, it will be at position 10. You can see that lines intersect. It tells us that they are going to be a fleet. You can also see that the blue line intersects with the orange line before the green line does, meaning that it will be traveling with the same rate as the orange one.\nNow when we know the idea, we can get into the solution to this problem. One way to solve this problem is to calculate intersections, but more easier way would be to determine in what time cars are going to reach their destination.\nIf the car with position 5 reaches the destination before or at the same time as the position 7, this means that they become a car fleet. We know at what speed each car is traveling, so we can calculate the time when they will reach the destination.\nTo do that, we will take our target, subtract the position, and divide it by the speed. After calculation, you can see that cars at position 5 and 7 are going to collide. Now we can delete a car.\nWe are going to remove the car that is not ahead, because when the cars collide, the speed is going to be reduced to the car that is ahead. We are going to look from right to left because, if we go from left to right, we do not know at what speed the blue car is going to travel, and we can’t assume that the car is going to travel with the same speed and will not collide with somebody else and slow down. We will be using a stack to solve this problem:\nInitially, our stack is going to be empty We are going to go through elements in reverse order We are going to add the first car to our stack Next, we are going to take the next car and add it to the top of the stack Then we are going to compare both cars to see if they collide with each other Then we are going to remove the car that is on top of the stack Next steps will be the same as above Time/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(n*logn) Space complexity: O(n) Thank you for reading! 😊 ",

<p>If a car catches up to a car fleet at the mile <code>target</code>, it will still be considered as part of the car fleet.</p>
<p>Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.</p>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
* The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12. The fleet forms at target.
* The car starting at 0 (speed 1) does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
* The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
</code></pre><pre tabindex="0"><code>Input: target = 10, position = [3], speed = [3]

<p>Before we jump into the solution, let&rsquo;s draw a visual representation of two cars that are traveling with different speeds and different positions.
The first car is traveling with speed 10 miles per hour and it&rsquo;s first in the line. The second car is traveling with speed 20 miles per hour and it&rsquo;s second in the line.

The faster car will eventually catch up and will be travelling with the same speed as the first car because the road has a single line.
When the faster car catches up, its speed will be reduced to the speed of the slower one.
Once cars are traveling next to each other, that is called a car fleet and cars are assumed to have the same exact position.

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at another example with <code>[position, speed] = [[3, 3], [5, 2], [7, 1]]</code>

    
    <input type="checkbox" id="zoomCheck-61256" hidden>
    <label for="zoomCheck-61256">
        <img class="zoomCheck" loading="lazy" decoding="async" 
            src="images/853-2.png#center" alt="alt image" 
             />
    </label>
</p>
<p>We start with position <code>3</code> and speed <code>3</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>At one second, it will be at position <code>6</code>;</li>
<li>at two seconds, it will be at position <code>9</code>;</li>
<li>and at three seconds, it will be at position <code>12</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, the position starts at <code>5</code> and speed <code>2</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>At one second, it will be at position <code>7</code>;</li>
<li>at two seconds, it will be at position <code>9</code>;</li>
<li>and at three seconds, it will be at position <code>11</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, we have position <code>7</code> and speed <code>1</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>At one second, it will be at position <code>8</code>;</li>
<li>at two seconds, it will be at position <code>9</code>;</li>
<li>and at three seconds, it will be at position <code>10</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see that lines intersect. It tells us that they are going to be a fleet. You can also see that the blue line intersects with the orange line before the green line does, meaning that it will be traveling with the same rate as the orange one.</p>
<p>Now when we know the idea, we can get into the solution to this problem.

    
    <input type="checkbox" id="zoomCheck-379e5" hidden>
    <label for="zoomCheck-379e5">
        <img class="zoomCheck" loading="lazy" decoding="async" 
            src="images/853-3.png#center" alt="alt image" 
             />
    </label>

One way to solve this problem is to calculate intersections, but more easier way would be to determine in what time cars are going to reach their destination.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the car with position <code>5</code> reaches the destination before or at the same time as the position <code>7</code>, this means that they become a car fleet.</li>
</ul>
<p>We know at what speed each car is traveling, so we can calculate the time when they will reach the destination.</p>
<ul>
<li>To do that, we will take our target, subtract the position, and divide it by the speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>After calculation, you can see that cars at position <code>5</code> and <code>7</code> are going to collide.
Now we can delete a car.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are going to remove the car that is not ahead, because when the cars collide, the speed is going to be reduced to the car that is ahead.</li>
<li>We are going to look from right to left because, if we go from left to right, we do not know at what speed the blue car is going to travel, and we can&rsquo;t assume that the car is going to travel with the same speed and will not collide with somebody else and slow down.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be using a stack to solve this problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initially, our stack is going to be empty</li>
<li>We are going to go through elements in reverse order</li>
<li>We are going to add the first car to our stack</li>
<li>Next, we are going to take the next car and add it to the top of the stack</li>
<li>Then we are going to compare both cars to see if they collide with each other</li>
<li>Then we are going to remove the car that is on top of the stack</li>
<li>Next steps will be the same as above</li>
</ul>
