I attached links to the material to help you understand it more deeply. https://youtu.be/4rLW7zg21gI?si=49hq8Wrbpmeev41k https://youtu.be/r2__Rw8vu1M?si=b7b257Qu4Bty7OxA I will focus on implementation.\nThe old and modern way of implementing concurrency You can divide concurrency implementation into old or unstructured and modern or structured.\nBy old, I mean GCD (Grand Central Dispatch). By modern, I mean async/await, actor, and Task.\nIn this article, I will talk about the old way. GCD helps you keep your distance from manually managing threads and avoid unnecessary complexity, and it does it by providing API. One of these APIs is DispatchQueue.\nDispatchQueue By default, DispatchQueue is serial; all work on this queue will be executed sequentially. DispatchQueue has access to the main property and the global() method. The main property returns the serial queue associated with the main thread of the current process. The global() method returns a concurrent queue specified by quality-of-service level.\npublic class func global(qos: DispatchQoS.QoSClass = .default) -\u003e DispatchQueue You can pass many parameters when you try to initialize a new queue.\npublic convenience init(label: String, qos: DispatchQoS = .unspecified, attributes: DispatchQueue.Attributes = [], autoreleaseFrequency: DispatchQueue.AutoreleaseFrequency = .inherit, target: DispatchQueue? = nil) Let’s talk about three of them (label, qos, attributes). The first is label, which is used mainly for debugging and identification.\nlet queue = DispatchQueue(label: \"com.example.myqueue\") The second one is qos (Quality Of Service) allows you to choose the priority in which you like to run your task. You can choose between background, utility, default, userInitiated, userIneractive, and unspecified priorities.\n/// qos_class_t public struct DispatchQoS : Equatable { public let qosClass: DispatchQoS.QoSClass public let relativePriority: Int @available(macOS 10.10, iOS 8.0, *) public static let background: DispatchQoS @available(macOS 10.10, iOS 8.0, *) public static let utility: DispatchQoS @available(macOS 10.10, iOS 8.0, *) public static let `default`: DispatchQoS @available(macOS 10.10, iOS 8.0, *) public static let userInitiated: DispatchQoS @available(macOS 10.10, iOS 8.0, *) public static let userInteractive: DispatchQoS public static let unspecified: DispatchQoS } userIneractive has the highest priority; it usually calls when you need to display UI almost immediately.\nbackground, on the other hand, has the lowest priority.\nHow to achieve concurrency with DispatchQueue API? You can use a serial queue with the following: sync functionality allows you to wait until the block you passed finishes its work.\nlet serialQueue = DispatchQueue(label: \"com.example.myqueue.serial\") serialQueue.sync {} async functionality will schedule your work and be executed later in time.\nlet serialQueue = DispatchQueue(label: \"com.example.myqueue.serial\") serialQueue.async {} Or you can use a concurrent queue with similar methods but running your task in parallel.\nlet concurrentQueue = DispatchQueue(label: \"com.example.myqueue.concurrent\", attributes: .concurrent) concurrentQueue.sync {} concurrentQueue.async {} The difference between serial queue and concurrent queue The difference between a serial and concurrent queue is that you should not wait until the concurrent operation finishes work in the async block.\nlet concurrentQueue = DispatchQueue(label: \"com.example.myqueue.concurrent\", attributes: .concurrent) concurrentQueue.sync { for i in 1...5 { print(\"Task \\(i) is running on Concurrent Queue\") sleep(1) // Simulate some work } } concurrentQueue.sync { for i in 6...10 { print(\"Task \\(i) is running on Concurrent Queue\") sleep(1) // Simulate some work } } // prints Task 1 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 6 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 2 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 7 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 3 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 8 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 4 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 9 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 5 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 10 is running on Concurrent Queue The serial queue executes tasks in order, and you should wait until the first async block finishes its work to start the second block.\nlet serialQueue = DispatchQueue(label: \"com.example.myqueue.serual\") serialQueue.sync { for i in 1...5 { print(\"Task \\(i) is running on Serial Queue\") sleep(1) // Simulate some work } } serialQueue.sync { for i in 6...10 { print(\"Task \\(i) is running on Serial Queue\") sleep(1) // Simulate some work } } // prints Task 1 is running on Serial Queue Task 2 is running on Serial Queue Task 3 is running on Serial Queue Task 4 is running on Serial Queue Task 5 is running on Serial Queue Task 6 is running on Serial Queue Task 7 is running on Serial Queue Task 8 is running on Serial Queue Task 9 is running on Serial Queue Task 10 is running on Serial Queue When you try to use the sync functionality, it behaves similarly on serial and concurrent queues by executing each task step by step and waiting till each block finishes its work.\nlet serialQueue = DispatchQueue(label: \"com.example.myqueue.serial\") serialQueue.sync { for i in 1...5 { print(\"Task \\(i) is running on Serial Queue\") sleep(1) // Simulate some work } } serialQueue.sync { for i in 6...10 { print(\"Task \\(i) is running on Serial Queue\") sleep(1) // Simulate some work } } // prints Task 1 is running on Serial Queue Task 2 is running on Serial Queue Task 3 is running on Serial Queue Task 4 is running on Serial Queue Task 5 is running on Serial Queue Task 6 is running on Serial Queue Task 7 is running on Serial Queue Task 8 is running on Serial Queue Task 9 is running on Serial Queue Task 10 is running on Serial Queue let concurrentQueue = DispatchQueue(label: \"com.example.myqueue.concurrent\", attributes: .concurrent) concurrentQueue.sync { for i in 1...5 { print(\"Task \\(i) is running on Concurrent Queue\") sleep(1) // Simulate some work } } concurrentQueue.sync { for i in 6...10 { print(\"Task \\(i) is running on Concurrent Queue\") sleep(1) // Simulate some work } } // prints Task 1 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 2 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 3 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 4 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 5 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 6 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 7 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 8 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 9 is running on Concurrent Queue Task 10 is running on Concurrent Queue ",

<p>The system can perform multiple tasks simultaneously. By tasks, I mean <code>code or instructions</code>.
Modern computer chips have multiple cores that allow developers to create and run various tasks on multiple cores. Even if your chip has one core operating system it will provide context switching mechanism by enabling it to execute multiple tasks concurrently.</p>

I will focus on implementation.</p>
<h3 id="the-old-and-modern-way-of-implementing-concurrency">The <code>old</code> and <code>modern</code> way of implementing concurrency<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-old-and-modern-way-of-implementing-concurrency">#</a></h3>
<p>You can divide concurrency implementation into <code>old</code> or <code>unstructured</code> and <code>modern</code> or <code>structured</code>.</p>
<p>By <code>old</code>, I mean GCD (Grand Central Dispatch).
By <code>modern</code>, I mean async/await, actor, and Task.</p>
<p>In this article, I will talk about the <code>old</code> way.
GCD helps you keep your distance from manually managing threads and avoid unnecessary complexity, and it does it by providing API.
One of these APIs is DispatchQueue.</p>
<h3 id="dispatchqueue">DispatchQueue<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dispatchqueue">#</a></h3>
<p>By default, <code>DispatchQueue</code> is serial; all work on this queue will be executed sequentially.
<code>DispatchQueue</code> has access to the <code>main</code> property and the <code>global()</code> method.
The <code>main</code> property returns the serial queue associated with the main thread of the current process.
The <code>global()</code> method returns a concurrent queue specified by quality-of-service level.</p>
