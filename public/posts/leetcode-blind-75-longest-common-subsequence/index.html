If there is no common subsequence, return 0.\nA subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.\nFor example, ”ace” is a subsequence of ”abcde”. A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.\nExamples Input: text1 = \"abcde\", text2 = \"ace\" Output: 3 Explanation: The longest common subsequence is \"ace\" and its length is 3. Input: text1 = \"abc\", text2 = \"abc\" Output: 3 Explanation: The longest common subsequence is \"abc\" and its length is 3. Input: text1 = \"abc\", text2 = \"def\" Output: 0 Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0. Constraints 1 \u003c= text1.length, text2.length \u003c= 1000 text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters. Explanation Before we jump to coding, let’s look at visual representation with some examples to better understand the problem.\nAn example with input text1 = \"abcde\", text2 = \"ace\"\nWe can see that we have two equal characters a at the beginning of both strings. This means that if both characters match each other, then we can break it into subproblems. This also means that now we are looking into a subproblem of the remainder of both strings plus 1 because we know that the longest subsequence at least is going to be 1 since we found matching pairs of characters.\nLet’s look at an example if the first characters were different: input text1 = “bbcde\", text2 = \"ace\"\nWe can’t add 1 and find the longest subsequence because the first characters are different, but it’s possible that the longest subsequence can be between bbcde and ce or it could be between bcde and ace.\nBasically, what we find out based on comparing the first characters — whether they are equal or not — is that we can break the problem into subproblems and solve them.\nRecursion Solution func longestCommonSubsequence(_ text1: String, _ text2: String) -\u003e Int { let text1Array = Array(text1) let text2Array = Array(text2) let text1Count = text1.count let text2Count = text2.count func dfs(_ i: Int, _ j: Int) -\u003e Int { if i == text1Count || j == text2Count { return 0 } if text1Array[i] == text2Array[j] { return 1 + dfs(i + 1, j + 1) } return max(dfs(i + 1, j), dfs(i, j + 1)) } return dfs(0, 0) } Explanation One way to solve this problem is by using the depth-first search algorithm.\nWe will need to take care of a few base cases:\nwhen we reach the end of one of the texts when we find matching characters In the result, we will be returning the max of two values.\nIt is not a very efficient solution because it will take O(2^(m+n)) time complexity, but we can optimize it.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(2^(m+n)) Space complexity: O(m+n) where m is the length of string text1 and n is the length of string text2 Dynamic Programming Top-Down Solution func longestCommonSubsequence(_ text1: String, _ text2: String) -\u003e Int { let text1Array = Array(text1) let text2Array = Array(text2) let text1Count = text1.count let text2Count = text2.count var memo: [IndexHelper: Int] = [:] func dfs(_ i: Int, _ j: Int) -\u003e Int { if i == text1Count || j == text2Count { return 0 } if memo[IndexHelper(i: i, j: j)] != nil { return memo[IndexHelper(i: i, j: j)]! } if text1Array[i] == text2Array[j] { memo[IndexHelper(i: i, j: j)] = 1 + dfs(i + 1, j + 1) } else { memo[IndexHelper(i: i, j: j)] = max(dfs(i + 1, j), dfs(i, j + 1)) } return memo[IndexHelper(i: i, j: j)]! } return dfs(0, 0) } struct IndexHelper: Hashable { let i: Int let j: Int } Explanation We learned from the previous solution that we can optimize time complexity. We can do it by caching. Caching will help us reduce time complexity from O(2^(m+n)) to O(m*n).\nBase cases and algorithm stay the same; all that we needed to do is to add a hash map where we can store and retrieve stored results.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(m*n) Space complexity: O(m*n) where m is the length of string text1 and n is the length of string text2 Dynamic Programming Bottom-Up Solution func longestCommonSubsequence(_ text1: String, _ text2: String) -\u003e Int { let text1Array = Array(text1) let text2Array = Array(text2) let text1Count = text1.count let text2Count = text2.count var dp: [[Int]] = Array(repeating: Array(repeating: 0, count: text2Count + 1), count: text1Count + 1) for i in stride(from: text1Count - 1, to: -1, by: -1) { for j in stride(from: text2Count - 1, to: -1, by: -1) { if text1Array[i] == text2Array[j] { dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i + 1][j + 1] } else { dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j + 1], dp[i + 1][j]) } } } return dp[0][0] } Explanation Another way to solve this problem is by using the dynamic programming bottom-up approach.\nLet’s visualize input with text1 = \"abcde\", text2 = \"ace\"\nWe have a 2D matrix that we are going to use as a representation of our text1 and text2.\nWe start by comparing values at indices 0, 0, and we can see that we have a match a == a, and we do not need to check it anymore After that we are going diagonally and compare c == b, they are not equal, and we cannot go diagonally. Since these two characters are not equal, we need to check two different subproblems, and we have two decisions — go right or go down If we go down, we can see that characters c == c and we can go diagonally because we want to look at the last two substrings When we compare d == e we see that they are not equal, then we can’t go diagonally and we need to go to the right and down to find whatever max is and put it in the cell We see that if we go to the right, we are going to be out of bounds, therefore the longest subsequence between a string and out-of-bounds value is going to be 0 The right out-of-bounds column would be filled with 0s. Similarly, the bottom rows also will be filled with 0s When we continue looking from d and e position, we see that we can’t go to the right because we will get 0, and this is not our max value, let’s go down When we go down, we find that e == e and we can look diagonally and put 1 to our row Since we looked through all possible combinations and reached the end of the strings, we can now backtrack along the path that we came from and find the solution.\nWe had 1 at position e and e At position d and e, we went down because d and e characters did not match, so we are going to get value 1 from e and e position and put it into the position of d and e Now we are going back to c and c diagonally, we are doing it because characters c and c match, so we are going to get value of 1 from position d and e, and put it to position c and c and add additional 1 to it, so now the value at position c and c equals 2 From position c and c we are going up and put 2 to b and c row because characters did not match Lastly, we are going back to position a and a diagonally because characters are matching each other, we pass value 2 to it from position b and c, and add additional value of 1, so result at position a and a will be 3, meaning that the longest common subsequence is equal to 3. You can see that we started from the bottom and worked our way up, that’s why this solution is called bottom-up.\nTime/ Space complexity Time complexity: O(m*n) Space complexity: O(m*n) where m is the length of string text1 and n is the length of string text2 Thank you for reading! 😊 ",

<p>Given two strings <code>text1</code> and <code>text2</code>, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, <code>”ace”</code> is a subsequence of <code>”abcde”</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.</p>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>Input: text1 = &#34;abcde&#34;, text2 = &#34;ace&#34; 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is &#34;ace&#34; and its length is 3.
</code></pre><pre tabindex="0"><code>Input: text1 = &#34;abc&#34;, text2 = &#34;abc&#34;

</code></pre><pre tabindex="0"><code>Input: text1 = &#34;abc&#34;, text2 = &#34;def&#34;

<ul>
<li>1 &lt;= text1.length, text2.length &lt;= 1000</li>
<li>text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="explanation">Explanation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#explanation">#</a></h4>
<p>Before we jump to coding, let&rsquo;s look at visual representation with some examples to better understand the problem.<br>
An example with input <code>text1 = &quot;abcde&quot;, text2 = &quot;ace&quot;</code><br>

    
    <input type="checkbox" id="zoomCheck-9f8fb" hidden>
    <label for="zoomCheck-9f8fb">
        <img class="zoomCheck" loading="lazy" decoding="async" 
            src="images/1143.png#center" alt="alt image" 
             />
    </label>
</p>
<p>We can see that we have two equal characters <code>a</code> at the beginning of both strings. This means that if both characters match each other, then we can break it into subproblems. This also means that now we are looking into a subproblem of the remainder of both strings plus <code>1</code> because we know that the longest subsequence at least is going to be 1 since we found matching pairs of characters.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example if the first characters were different: input <code>text1 = “bbcde&quot;, text2 = &quot;ace&quot;</code><br>

    
    <input type="checkbox" id="zoomCheck-06022" hidden>
    <label for="zoomCheck-06022">
        <img class="zoomCheck" loading="lazy" decoding="async" 
            src="images/1143-1.png#center" alt="alt image" 
             />
    </label>
</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t add 1 and find the longest subsequence because the first characters are different, but it&rsquo;s possible that the longest subsequence can be between <code>bbcde</code> and <code>ce</code> or it could be between <code>bcde</code> and <code>ace</code>.</p>
<p>Basically, what we find out based on comparing the first characters — whether they are equal or not — is that we can break the problem into subproblems and solve them.</p>

<p>One way to solve this problem is by using the depth-first search algorithm.</p>
<p>We will need to take care of a few base cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>when we reach the end of one of the texts</li>
<li>when we find matching characters</li>
</ul>
<p>In the result, we will be returning the max of two values.</p>
<p>It is not a very efficient solution because it will take O(2^(m+n)) time complexity, but we can optimize it.</p>

<p>Another way to solve this problem is by using the dynamic programming bottom-up approach.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s visualize input with <code>text1 = &quot;abcde&quot;, text2 = &quot;ace&quot;</code><br>

    
    <input type="checkbox" id="zoomCheck-524ae" hidden>
    <label for="zoomCheck-524ae">
        <img class="zoomCheck" loading="lazy" decoding="async" 
            src="images/1143-2.png#center" alt="alt image" 
             />
    </label>
</p>
<p>We have a 2D matrix that we are going to use as a representation of our <code>text1</code> and <code>text2</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>We start by comparing values at indices <code>0, 0</code>, and we can see that we have a match <code>a == a</code>, and we do not need to check it anymore</li>
<li>After that we are going diagonally and compare <code>c == b</code>, they are not equal, and we cannot go diagonally. Since these two characters are not equal, we need to check two different subproblems, and we have two decisions — go right or go down</li>
<li>If we go down, we can see that characters <code>c == c</code> and we can go diagonally because we want to look at the last two substrings</li>
<li>When we compare <code>d == e</code> we see that they are not equal, then we can’t go diagonally and we need to go to the right and down to find whatever max is and put it in the cell</li>
<li>We see that if we go to the right, we are going to be out of bounds, therefore the longest subsequence between a string and out-of-bounds value is going to be <code>0</code></li>
<li>The right out-of-bounds column would be filled with <code>0</code>s. Similarly, the bottom rows also will be filled with <code>0</code>s</li>
<li>When we continue looking from <code>d</code> and <code>e</code> position, we see that we can’t go to the right because we will get <code>0</code>, and this is not our max value, let’s go down</li>
<li>When we go down, we find that <code>e == e</code> and we can look diagonally and put <code>1</code> to our row</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we looked through all possible combinations and reached the end of the strings, we can now backtrack along the path that we came from and find the solution.<br>

    
    <input type="checkbox" id="zoomCheck-9678a" hidden>
    <label for="zoomCheck-9678a">
        <img class="zoomCheck" loading="lazy" decoding="async" 
            src="images/1143-3.png#center" alt="alt image" 
             />
    </label>
</p>
<ul>
<li>We had <code>1</code> at position <code>e</code> and <code>e</code></li>
<li>At position <code>d</code> and <code>e</code>, we went down because <code>d</code> and <code>e</code> characters did not match, so we are going to get value <code>1</code> from <code>e</code> and <code>e</code> position and put it into the position of <code>d</code> and <code>e</code></li>
<li>Now we are going back to <code>c</code> and <code>c</code> diagonally, we are doing it because characters <code>c</code> and <code>c</code> match, so we are going to get value of <code>1</code> from position <code>d</code> and <code>e</code>, and put it to position <code>c</code> and <code>c</code> and add additional <code>1</code> to it, so now the value at position <code>c</code> and <code>c</code> equals <code>2</code></li>
<li>From position <code>c</code> and <code>c</code> we are going up and put <code>2</code> to <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> row because characters did not match</li>
<li>Lastly, we are going back to position <code>a</code> and <code>a</code> diagonally because characters are matching each other, we pass value <code>2</code> to it from position <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>, and add additional value of <code>1</code>, so result at position <code>a</code> and <code>a</code> will be <code>3</code>, meaning that the longest common subsequence is equal to <code>3</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see that we started from the bottom and worked our way up, that’s why this solution is called bottom-up.</p>
