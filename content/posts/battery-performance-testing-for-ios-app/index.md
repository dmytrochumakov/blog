### Introduction
Working with batteries on iOS devices for large applications has always been tricky. The amount of energy consumed by the `screen`, `location services`, `network calls`, `processing`, `background tasks`, etc., is significant. From a developer's perspective, it seems complicated, but Xcode provides tools to address this problem.

To find the issue, you need to open Xcode and go to the `Debug Navigator`.

In the `Debug Navigator`, you will see the `Energy Impact` gauge.

In the histogram, `blue` indicates good performance, while `red` indicates overhead.

Based on this information, you can analyze the overhead and resolve potential issues by utilizing `Instruments` such as `Network`, `Location`, `CPU Profile`, etc. For each case, Xcode provides instruments that allow you to dive deeper and understand what is happening in detail.
