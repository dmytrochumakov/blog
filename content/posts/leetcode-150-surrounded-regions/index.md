### The problem

You are given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing letters `'X'` and `'O'`, capture regions that are surrounded:

* Connect: A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.
* Region: To form a region connect every `'O'` cell.
* Surround: The region is surrounded with `'X'` cells if you can connect the region with `'X'` cells and none of the region cells are on the edge of the `board`.

To capture a surrounded region, replace all `'O'`s with `'X'`s in-place within the original board. You do not need to return anything.

#### Examples

```
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

In the above diagram, the bottom region is not captured because it is on the edge of the board and cannot be surrounded.
```

```
Input: board = [["X"]]

Output: [["X"]]
```

#### Constraints

* m == board.length
* n == board[i].length
* 1 <= m, n <= 200
* board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.

#### Explanation

From the description of the problem, we learn that we are given an `m*n` matrix that contains only `X`s and `O`s, and we want to capture all regions that are surrounded by `X`s. Capturing a region is defined by flipping `O`s into `X`s only if `O`s are surrounded by `X`s.
Letâ€™s look at our example:
![alt image](images/130.png#center)

* In this example, we have two different regions. We have two regions because we only mark an area as a region if cells are connected in four directions `(up, down, right, left)`; cells cannot be connected diagonally.

On the result side of the picture, you can see that the region in the middle was flipped. That region was flipped because it was surrounded by `X`s.

As for the second region that is placed in the last row, you can see that in the result picture it is not replaced with `X`. We canâ€™t flip that region because it is only connected in three directions â€” `top, left, right` â€” but not `bottom`, which is on the border and out of bounds.

### Depth First Search Solution

```swift
func solve(_ board: inout [[Character]]) {
    let rows = board.count
    let cols = board[0].count

    func capture(_ r: Int, _ c: Int) {
        if (r < 0 || c < 0 || r == rows || c == cols || board[r][c] != "O") {
            return
        }
        board[r][c] = "T"
        capture(r - 1, c)
        capture(r + 1, c)
        capture(r , c - 1)
        capture(r , c + 1)
    }

    for r in 0 ..< rows {
        for c in 0 ..< cols {
            if (board[r][c] == "O" && ([0, rows - 1].contains(r) || [0, cols - 1].contains(c))) {
                capture(r, c)
            }
        }
    }

    for r in 0 ..< rows {
        for c in 0 ..< cols {
            if board[r][c] == "O" {
                board[r][c] = "X"
            }
        }
    }

    for r in 0 ..< rows {
        for c in 0 ..< cols {
            if board[r][c] == "T" {
                board[r][c] = "O"
            }
        }
    }

}
```

#### Explanation

We can start solving this problem in reverse order:

* First, we are going to find every region that we cannot flip.
* Second, we are going to find all regions that we can flip.

We are going to scan through every border cell and look for any `O`s.

You can see that in our example we have one region that we canâ€™t flip; therefore, we are going to mark it as `T` â€” a temporary variable that will indicate that this region cannot be flipped.

Next, we are going to iterate through every cell that is not marked as `T` and change it to `X`.

Lastly, we are going to change back all `T` cells to `O`s, and we will return our result.

#### Time/Space complexity

* Time complexity: O(m*n)
* Space complexity: O(m*n)
* Where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns
