### The problem

Given an array `nums` of distinct integers, return all the possible permutations. You can return the answer in any order.

> A permutation is a rearrangement of all the elements of an array.

#### Examples

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]
```

```
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
```

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```

#### Constraints

* 1 <= nums.length <= 6
* -10 <= nums\[i] <= 10
* All the integers of nums are unique.

#### Explanation

From the description of the problem we learn that we need to return all possible permutations from an array of distinct integer values.

Letâ€™s look at the example with input `nums = [1, 2, 3]` and try to understand how permutations will look.

We have three numbers therefore we have three positions to build:

* For the first position we have `three` choices, we can pick any element from our input
* For the second position we donâ€™t know what element we picked before, but we know that we have only `two` elements remaining
* For the third position we only can pick `one` element

If we multiply `3*2*1` we will get `6` that tells us that in total we will have `six` different permutations for given input `[1, 2, 3]`.

To better understand how permutation will look letâ€™s look at the decision tree of input `[1, 2, 3]`.

You can see that we have `six` permutations and every single one of them is different. We can solve this problem by using recursion but we will need to do a lot of bookkeeping because at each decision we need to add and remove elements.

We can choose a slightly easier approach by looking at it from a subproblems perspective.

### Recursion Solution

```swift
func permute(_ nums: [Int]) -> [[Int]] {
    let n = nums.count

    if n == 0 {
        return [[]]
    }

    let perms = permute(Array(nums[1..<n]))
    var res: [[Int]] = []

    for p in perms {
        for i in 0 ... p.count {
            var pCopy = p
            pCopy.insert(nums[0], at: i)
            res.append(pCopy)
        }
    }

    return res
}
```

#### Explanation

From the explanation above we learn that we can use subproblems to solve this problem.
![alt image](images/46-3.png#center)
Instead of branching our decision tree at the first step we can get all permutations from `1, 2, 3`:
* Next, the subproblem will be only with `2, 3` numbers
* Next, we will get permutations for the single number `3`
* Lastly, when we donâ€™t have any elements we will return an `empty` array

Now, when we have our subproblems we can find our result by moving from the bottom up:
![alt image](images/46-4.png#center)

* If we donâ€™t have any elements we will be returning up an `empty` array
* For the single value of `3` we can return only `one` permutation `[[3]]`
* For values `2, 3` we will be returning `two` permutations `[[2, 3], [3, 2]]` because at this point we have all permutations for value `3`, now we need to add value `2`. We know that we have two choices, we can put value `2` in the front of the array or we can put value `2` at the back.
* Lastly, for values `1, 2, 3` we are going to put value `1` in every position - we are going to try to put value `1` at the beginning, middle, and the end of the array, as a result we are going to end up with `three` different permutations.

In result for values `[2, 3]` we will have `[1, 2, 3], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1]` permutations, and for values `[3, 2]` we will have `[1, 3, 2], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]` permutations, in total we will have `6` permutations.

#### Time/ Space complexity

* Time complexity: O(n!\*n^2)
* Space complexity: O(n!\*n)
