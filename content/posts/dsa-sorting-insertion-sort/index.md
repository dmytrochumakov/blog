### Introduction 
The [insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort) algorithm builds a sorted list one item at a time [by comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_sort). It is more efficient on small datasets but much less efficient on larger ones.

### Code Example 
```swift 
func insertionSort(_ array: [Int]) -> [Int] {
    var A = array
    for i in 0 ..< A.count {
        var j = i
        while j > 0 && A[j - 1] > A[j] {
            let tmp = A[j]
            A[j] = A[j - 1]
            A[j - 1] = tmp
            j -= 1
        }
    }
    return A
}
```

#### Implementation 
1. For each index in the input array:
   1. Set the `j` variable to `i`. 
2. Loop while `j` is greater than `0` and the element at index `j - 1` is greater than the element at index `j`:  
   1. Swap the elements at index `j` and `j - 1`.  
   2. Decrement `j` by 1.

### Why use Insertion Sort?
- Fast for small data sets. More efficient in practice than most other algorithms, such as selection sort or bubble sort.
- [Adaptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_sort): Efficient for datasets that are already substantially sorted; the time complexity is O(kn) when each element in the input is no more than *k* places away from its sorted position.
- [Stable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_sort): Does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys.
- [In-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm): Only requires O(1) of additional memory space.
- [Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm): Can sort a list as it receives it.

### Time/Space Complexity 
- Time: O(N^2)  
- Space: O(1) (in-place)
