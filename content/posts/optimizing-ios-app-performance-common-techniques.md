### Introduction

A well-performing application is the heart of a good user experience. If an application responds well, it helps attract more users and grow the business around it. On the other hand, if it performs poorly, it frustrates users and leads them to uninstall the app. To solve these issues, we need tools to monitor app behavior. Luckily for us, Xcode provides a list of tools that will help us resolve these problems. 

### Common Problems
If I could generalize common problems that every iOS developer deals with while working on a multi-user app, it would be:

* Unresponsiveness and hangs
* Memory issues
* Power-consumption issues
* I/O issues
* Network-related issues
* Slow app launch time

### Ways to Address Common Problems
If you want to improve any of these categories, Apple provides developers multiple ways to do it:
- The first way is to use [`Xcode Organizer`](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10076) to view metrics for launch time, memory usage, energy consumption, etc.
- The second way is to collect health information about your app using [`MetricKit`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MetricKit).
- The third way is to get feedback from [`TestFlight`](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) testers about their experience using the beta version of your app.
- The fourth way is to get feedback from real users through email or an interface inside your app.

### Tools That Can Help Solve Problems
If you have `Unresponsiveness and hangs`, you can use the [Time Profiler](https://help.apple.com/instruments/mac/current/#/dev44b2b437) tool to find what causes the problem.
- For `Memory issues`, you can use [Allocations](https://help.apple.com/instruments/mac/10.0/#/dev7b8f6eb6) and [Leaks](https://help.apple.com/instruments/mac/current/#/dev022f987b).
- For `Power-consumption issues`, you can use the [Energy Log](https://help.apple.com/instruments/mac/current/#/deva0db8947) tool.
- For `I/O issues`, you can use the [File Activity](https://help.apple.com/instruments/mac/current/#/dev6983c7c4) tool.
- For `Network-related issues`, you can use the [Network Template](https://help.apple.com/instruments/mac/10.0/#/dev209edacf) tool.

### Resources
If you want more detailed information about optimizing app performance, I recommend reading the [official Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/improving-your-app-s-performance/). It describes techniques in depth and has a lot of related resources and recommendations.
