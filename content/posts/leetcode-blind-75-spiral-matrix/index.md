### The problem 
Given anÂ `m x n`Â `matrix`, returnÂ all elements of theÂ `matrix`Â in spiral order.

#### Examples

``` 
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
```

```
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]]
Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]
```

#### Constraints
* m == matrix.length  
* n == matrix[i].length  
* 1 <= m, n <= 10  
* -100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100

#### Explanation
Let's look at the example with `matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]` and try to figure out a way to solve this problem.

We are going to start from the top left corner:  
- Go right from `1` to `2`,  
- Go right again from `2` to `3`, now we canâ€™t go right anymore  
- Next, we go down from `3` to `6`,  
- Go down one more time from `6` to `9`,  
- Now we are going to go left from `9` to `8` because we canâ€™t go down anymore,  
- Go left again from `8` to `7`  
- We canâ€™t go left anymore, so we go up from `7` to `4`, and if we try to go up, we see that we already visited it and we canâ€™t go there  
- Lastly, we go right from `4` to `5`. If we try to go right, we can see that we cannot go right anymore because we already visited that element

To solve this problem we are going to start from the top left corner:  
- Go right until we visit all of them  
- Next, we go down and visit all available elements  
- Next, we go left and visit all of the elements  
- Next, we go up  

We went through all four directions, but we still have some elements left.  
- We took the outermost layer and shrank it. Now we have a sub-matrix, and we can do the same algorithm on it.  
- We can do it by introducing `left` and `right` boundaries that we move inward by `1`. 
- Similarly, we have `top` and `bottom` boundaries that we also need to shrink by `1`.  
- After that, we are going to solve the sub-matrix in spiral order by going from `top` `left` to the `right`.  
- You can notice that weâ€™ve gone through all elements, so now we can move our `left` and `right` boundaries once more, and stop because we donâ€™t have a rectangle anymore and we visited all elements.

### Iteration Solution 
```swift
func spiralOrder(_ matrix: [[Int]]) -> [Int] {
    var res: [Int] = []
    var l = 0
    var r = matrix[0].count
    var top = 0
    var bottom = matrix.count

    while l < r && top < bottom {
        for i in l ..< r {
            res.append(matrix[top][i])
        }
        top += 1

        for i in top ..< bottom {
            res.append(matrix[i][r - 1])
        }
        r -= 1

        if !(l < r && top < bottom) {
            break
        }

        for i in stride(from: r - 1, to: l - 1, by: -1) {
            res.append(matrix[bottom - 1][i])
        }
        bottom -= 1

        for i in stride(from: bottom - 1, to: top - 1, by: -1) {
            res.append(matrix[i][l])
        }
        l += 1
    }

    return res
}
```

#### Explanation
![alt image](images/54-2.png#center)

We are going to initialize the `left` boundary at `0`, `right` at `len(matrix[0])`, `top` at `0`, and `bottom` at `len(matrix)` to solve this problem in an easier way and avoid edge cases.  
We are always going to start at the `top` `left` position.  
- After that, we are going to go `right` and iterate through the first row, adding values to our result until we reach our `right` boundary.  
- Now we can go `down`, so we need to shift our `top` boundary down by `1`, add values to our result, and continue going down until we reach our `bottom` boundary  
- We can see that we visited all elements in the last column, therefore we can now move our `right` boundary by decreasing it by `1`  
- Next, we can go through elements to the `left` until we reach our `left` boundary and add those elements to our result  
- When we reach the `left` boundary, you can see that we also finished the entire `bottom` row, meaning that we can shift our `bottom` boundary up by `1`  
- Next, we are going to go `up` until we reach our `top` boundary, and add values to our result  
- When we reach our `top` boundary we can update our `left` boundary by increasing it by `1`  
- Next, we go `right` and add elements to our result until we reach our `right` boundary  
- Lastly, when the `left` boundary reaches the `right` boundary or `top` reaches `bottom`, we will stop our algorithm because weâ€™ve done every single element

#### Time/ Space complexity
* Time complexity: O(m*n)  
* Space complexity: O(1) extra memory, O(m*n) for the output list  
* Where `m` is the number of rows, and `n` is the number of columns
