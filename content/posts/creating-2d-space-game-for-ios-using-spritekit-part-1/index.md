### Introduction
I have never tried creating a game before; it feels like magic to me. I know that games have an enormous amount of underlying layers of abstractions and tools such as game engines, rendering, and so on. I have always been eager to learn at least 1% of the game creation process. In this article, I'm going to explore step-by-step instructions for creating a game for the iOS platform using SpriteKit.

### First Step
The first step is to create an Xcode project using the iOS game template and SpriteKit Game Technology.

### Second Step
The second step is to add resources like images and sounds. You can find assets inside the Assets folder [Download Project](https://github.com/dmytrochumakov/2d-space-game-ios/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

### Third Step
The third step is to override the `didMove(to:)` method - it tells you when the scene is presented by a view. This method is similar to `viewDidLoad` for `UIViewController`. We will be implementing logic inside it.
``` swift
override func didMove(to view: SKView) { }
```

### Creating and Adding Starfield Background
The next step is to create and add a starfield using [`SKEmitterNode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skemitternode) as a child to `SKScene`. After that, you will be able to see the starfield in the background.

```swift
self.starfield = SKEmitterNode(fileNamed: "Starfield")
starfield.position = CGPoint(x: self.frame.size.width / 2, y: self.frame.size.height)
starfield.advanceSimulationTime(10)

self.addChild(starfield)

starfield.zPosition = -1
```

#### Let's Dive a Little Deeper
##### Custom Particles Creation
If you were wondering how to create custom particles similar to the starfield background, you need to:
- Create a new SpriteKit Particle File:

- Choose a particle template:

- Select the created file -> Open the Inspectors side menu and configure it with settings that you like.

##### SKEmitterNode
Initialization of `SKEmitterNode(fileNamed: "Starfield")` helps create a starfield background.

> `SKEmitterNode` is a node that automatically creates and renders small particle sprites. Particles are privately owned by SpriteKitâ€”your game cannot access the generated sprites. For example, you cannot add physics shapes to particles. Emitter nodes are often used to create smoke, fire, sparks, and other particle effects.

##### advanceSimulationTime
`advanceSimulationTime(10)` - Advances the emitter particle simulation. In other words, you do not need to wait until the particles reach the bottom of the screen.

##### addChild
`self.addChild(starfield)` - Adds a node to the end of the receiverâ€™s list of child nodes. After that, you will be able to see the starfield background.

##### zPosition
`zPosition = -1` - Moves the starfield to the back of the screen.

Enormous appreciation for [Brian Advent](https://youtu.be/cJy61bOqQpg?si=Tei9yLmjD551q2Zx) for his comprehensive video. Without it, I would still be surfing the internet and collecting pieces of the puzzle.
