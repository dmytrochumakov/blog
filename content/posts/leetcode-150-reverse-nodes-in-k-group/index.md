### The problem

Given the `head` of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time, and return the modified list.

`k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then the left-out nodes at the end should remain as they are.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

#### Examples

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
```

![alt image](images/reverse_ex2.jpg#center)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
```

#### Constraints

* The number of nodes in the list is n.
* 1 <= k <= n <= 5000
* 0 <= Node.val <= 1000

Follow-up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra memory space?

#### Explanation

From the description of the problem, we learn that we are given a linked list and we want to reverse nodes `k at a time`.
Letâ€™s figure out what `k at a time` means by using the example `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` and `k = 2`.

* We can take our input and divide it into groups where each group has a size `k = 2`.
* Now we have two groups that we can take and reverse one by one. We also need to not forget to update our links where our nodes are pointing to.
* As for our last node that stays without a group, with value `5`, we donâ€™t need to make any changes to it because the problem statement says that we can leave it as it is.
* Lastly, after reversing groups, we must put them together by updating pointers.

### Solution

```swift
func reverseKGroup(_ head: ListNode?, _ k: Int) -> ListNode? {
    let dummy = ListNode(0, head)
    var groupPrev: ListNode? = dummy

    while true {
        let kth = getKth(groupPrev, k)
        if kth == nil {
            break
        }
        var groupNext = kth?.next
        // reverse
        var prev = kth?.next
        var curr = groupPrev?.next

        while curr !== groupNext {
            let tmp = curr!.next
            curr!.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = tmp
        }

        let tmp = groupPrev?.next
        groupPrev?.next = kth
        groupPrev = tmp
    }

    return dummy.next
}

func getKth(_ curr: ListNode?, _ k: Int) -> ListNode? {
    var curr = curr
    var k = k
    while curr != nil && k > 0 {
        curr = curr!.next
        k -= 1
    }
    return curr
}
```

#### Explanation

Now, when we figure out the general idea, letâ€™s look at the steps that we need to take to solve this problem. We will be using the same example as we did above.
![alt image](images/25-1.png#center)

* For starters, we will need a `dummy` node because we are potentially modifying the `head` of the linked list. It will help us deal with edge cases.
* Next, we will have a pointer that starts from the `dummy` node. We are going to iterate `k` times to find our first group and reverse it. After we reverse it, we can set our node with value `1` to the node where our condition is stopped â€” node after `k`, which is equal to `3`.
  ![alt image](images/25-2.png#center)
* Next, we are going to set the next pointer of our node with value `1` to the pointer where our condition is stopped â€” node with value `3`.
* We also need to update the `dummy` pointer so that it points to the node with value `2`.
  ![alt image](images/25-3.png#center)
* Now, we can move to the next group with values `3` and `4`.
* We are going to update the next pointer of the node with value `3` from pointing to `4` to pointing to `5`.
* Next, we are going to reverse the group.
  ![alt image](images/25-4.png#center)
* Next, we are going to set the next pointer of the node with value `1` to the node with value `4`.
* Lastly, we will try to check if we have another group, and we will find that we donâ€™t, because the next group only contains a single node with value `5`. Therefore, we will stop.

#### Time/ Space complexity

* Time complexity: O(n)
* Space complexity: O(1)
