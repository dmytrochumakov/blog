### The problem  
Given a positive integerÂ `n`, write a function that returns the number ofÂ set bitsÂ in its binary representation (also known as theÂ [Hamming weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

> A set bit refers to a bit in the binary representation of a number that has a value ofÂ 1.

#### Examples

``` 
Input:Â n = 11  
Output:Â 3  
Explanation:  
The input binary stringÂ 1011Â has a total of three set bits.
```

```
Input:Â n = 128  
Output:Â 1  
Explanation:  
The input binary stringÂ 10000000Â has a total of one set bit.
```

```
Input:Â n = 2147483645  
Output:Â 30  
Explanation:  
The input binary stringÂ 1111111111111111111111111111101Â has a total of thirty set bits.
```

#### Constraints  
* 1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1

Follow up:Â If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

#### Explanation  
The brute-force way to solve this problem is to go through every single character in the input string and count all `1`s. This solution will take O(n) time, but we actually can solve it in a more efficient way.  

### Bit Mask Solution  
``` swift 
func hammingWeight(_ n: Int) -> Int {
    var n = n
    var res = 0

    for i in 0 ..< 32 {
        if (((1 << i) & n) != 0) {
            res += 1
        }
    }

    return res
}
``` 

#### Explanation  
Another way that we can solve this problem is by using the logic `&` operator.

When we use the `&` operator on two values, we only get `1` in the case when both values have `1`, and other values will be converted to `0`.

At this moment we have a way to detect if the first bit is `1` or `0`, but we also need to look at the next bit, so we need to get the rest of the bits and shift them to the right by one.

This way we can compare two numbers, and if we detect `1`, then we update our result.  
We are using the range `0 .. < 32` because from the constraints we know that `n` fits into a 32-bit integer.

We also have a small downside in our solutionâ€”the algorithm has to look at every bit even if itâ€™s not `1`.

#### Time/ Space complexity  
* Time complexity: O(1)  
* Space complexity:Â O(1)  

### Bit Mask (Optimal) Solution  
``` swift 
func hammingWeight(_ n: Int) -> Int {
    var n = n
    var res = 0

    while n != 0 {
        n = n & (n - 1)
        res += 1
    }

    return res
}
```

#### Explanation  
We can solve this problem in an optimal way by running the algorithm as many times as there are `1`s in our input.  
![alt image](images/191-2.png#center)

We can do this by using the `&` operation, `n - 1` value, and incrementing our result by `1`.  
![alt image](images/191-3.png#center)

This solution works because we `&` the current `n` value with `n - 1`, and update our `n` value with the new one.  

- When we subtract `1` from `n`, we are getting rid of a bit.  
- We also use logic `&` to combine the two values, because we are removing one bit that contains `1`.
- Next, when we subtract `1`, we get rid of the next `1` bit.

Even when we introduce a bunch of other `1`s, this will not affect us because every new `1` bit that we introduced will be on the right side, and they do not matter because we `&` `n` with `n - 1`â€” they are all going to cancel out.

Basically, what we did is skip all `0`s in between, and we allowed ourselves to run the loop as many times as there are `1` bits in the input.

#### Time/ Space complexity  
* Time complexity: O(1)  
* Space complexity:Â O(1)
